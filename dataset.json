Cyber-attacks are becoming more frequent and sophisticated at an alarming rate in a world where data is a vital asset, and connections are becoming more and more widespread. Conventional security procedures, which have historically served as the mainstay of cybersecurity efforts, are frequently insufficient to counteract complex and dynamic threats. Since cybercriminals are always coming up with new ways to get beyond traditional defenses, it is critical that businesses implement more sophisticated security measures. The purpose of this study is to investigate and assess artificial intelligence's (AI) potential as a weapon to prevent cyberattacks and improve data security. Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, with their capacity to examine large volumes of data and spot trends, provide a potential method for instantly identifying and reducing cyberthreats. Cybersecurity systems can be mainly trained to identify and react to anomalies that might a point to a cyberattack by utilizing machine learning algorithms, neural networks, and also other AI approaches. **1.2 Relevance and Significance** As cyber threats continue to grow in frequency and complexity, the need for more advanced and adaptive security measures becomes increasingly crucial. AI offers promising capabilities in threat detection, automated response, and predictive analysis, which could significantly enhance cybersecurity efforts. This research is relevant to organizations seeking to strengthen their security posture and to the broader field of cybersecurity, contributing to the ongoing dialogue about the role of emerging technologies in protecting digital assets. **1.3 Research Questions** The primary research questions that will guide this study are as follows: 1. How can artificial intelligence be effectively leveraged to improve network and data security? 2. What are the current applications and limitations of AI in combating cyber-attacks? 3. What challenges and considerations should organizations be aware of when implementing AI driven security solutions? 4. How does the integration of AI in cybersecurity impact the overall security posture of an organization? 5. What are the prospects and potential advancements in AI-driven cybersecurity? **2.** **LITERATURE REVIEW** The integration of artificial intelligence in cybersecurity has gained significant attention in recent years. Numerous studies have explored the potential of AI in enhancing various aspects of data and network security. **ISSN: 3006-4023 (Online)         Yijie Weng, Jianhao Wu           DOI:** **10.60087                           Page: 393** **Threat Detection and Prevention:** Systems driven by AI have shown to be remarkably adept at spotting and stopping online threats. Older rule-based systems frequently can't keep up with the advanced strategies used by cybercriminals due to the growing complexity and volume of cyberattacks. On the other hand, AI and machine learning (ML) algorithms are highly effective in analyzing large amounts of data in order to quickly identify anomalies and possible security breaches. For this reason, they are essential components of contemporary cybersecurity tactics. Large-scale information, such as user activity logs, system events, and network traffic logs, can be combed through by machine learning algorithms to find patterns suggestive of malicious behavior. Because these algorithms can learn from past data, they can identify attack vectors that have never been observed before in addition to known dangers. AI systems can continuously improve their accuracy and speed in danger identification over time because to this adaptive learning process. According to Buczak and Guven's research, AI and ML algorithms speed up danger identification while simultaneously increasing threat detection accuracy. Conventional rule-based systems depend on preestablished signatures and rules, which might be out of date very fast when new threats appear. ML algorithms, on the other hand, could continuously learn from fresh data, which allows them to adapt to developing threats and shorten the time needed to detect and handle security events. **Automated Response and Incident Management:** Artificial intelligence (AI) solutions can respond to security problems quickly and automatically, cutting reaction times and potential damage. Automated reaction mechanisms play a critical role in cybersecurity by reducing the impact of assaults that happen quickly during digital transactions. Manual intervention is a common component of traditional incident response, but it can be laborious and error prone. In contrast, artificial intelligence (AI)-driven systems could continually monitor network activity, detect any attacks, and instantly launch pre-established reaction protocols, all of which improve an organization's overall security posture. Additionally, by integrating with different security platforms and technologies, AI can improve incident management by offering a cohesive and well-coordinated defense system. This integration makes sure that all the security infrastructure's parts, including firewalls, endpoint protection programs, and intrusion detection systems, operate together flawlessly. As a result, the cybersecurity ecosystem has become stronger and more resilient, able to ward against increasingly complex cyberattacks. **Predictive Analysis and Proactive Security:** Because AI can identify patterns and forecast trends, it is a powerful tool for preventive security measures. Rather of only responding to problems after they happen, proactive security involves foreseeing possible dangers and implementing countermeasures before an attack happens. This transition from reactive to proactive security is essential in a world where malicious cyberattacks are getting more complex and devastating. ISSN: 3006-4023 (Online),     Journal of Artificial Intelligence General Science (JAIGS) **DOI:** **10.60087** 394 In their discussion of the difficulties and potential applications of machine learning for network intrusion detection, Sommer and Paxson (2010) emphasized the significance of context-aware systems for attack prediction and mitigation. Large-scale datasets can be used to train machine learning algorithms to distinguish between typical and anomalous network behavior. AI systems can anticipate possible security breaches by identifying these patterns, which notifies managers to take precautionary action. **Human-AI Collaboration:** Experts who are human offer a distinct set of advantages. They can evaluate complicated situations and come to well-informed conclusions by applying creativity, critical thinking, and contextual knowledge. Experts in cybersecurity can authenticate alarms, analyze the data produced by AI systems, and thoroughly analyse occurrences. Based on their comprehension of new dangers and the larger security environment, they can also create fresh plans and policies. According to Hota and Shrivas (2019), cybersecurity efforts can be greatly boosted by a collaborative strategy in which AI systems and human specialists work together. AI, for example, may take care of repetitive chores like monitoring and early threat detection, freeing up human analysts to concentrate on more intricate and strategic matters. Human specialists can examine and look into an alarm that an AI system raises about a possible threat, then use their knowledge to decide on the best course of action. By working together, it is ensured that the advantages of AI and human intellect are fully utilized. Cybersecurity professionals must possess the necessary knowledge and abilities. This entails being aware of how AI algorithms work, deciphering their results, and incorporating AI instruments into alreadyin-use security procedures. Human specialists may remain ahead of changing dangers and technology breakthroughs with the support of ongoing training and professional development. **Privacy and Ethical Considerations:** Concerns about privacy and ethics are also raised using AI in cybersecurity. It is critical to address these issues as AI systems become more and more integrated into cybersecurity operations to make sure that the advantages of AI do not outweigh societal values and individual rights. In a thorough analysis of the ethical implications of artificial intelligence, Mittelstadt et al. (2016) emphasized several crucial concerns about algorithmic bias and data privacy that are especially pertinent to cybersecurity. The possibility of privacy violations by AI systems is one of the main worries. For AIdriven cybersecurity solutions to work well, large volumes of data must frequently be accessible. Sensitive personal data, conversations, and behavioral patterns may be included in this data. Although gathering, storing, and analyzing this data presents serious privacy concerns, it is necessary for AI algorithms to be trained and for the detection of abnormalities. **3** **METHODOLOGIES** This research employs a mixed-methods approach, combining qualitative analysis of existing literature with quantitative data from case studies and industry reports. The methodology includes: **ISSN: 3006-4023 (Online)         Yijie Weng, Jianhao Wu           DOI:** **10.60087                           Page: 395** 1.

AI-driven solutions offer improved threat detection, faster response times, and predictive capabilities that can strengthen an organization's overall security posture. However, ISSN: 3006-4023 (Online),     Journal of Artificial Intelligence General Science (JAIGS) **DOI:** **10.60087** 396 the effective implementation of AI in cybersecurity requires careful consideration of technical, ethical, and operational challenges. Organizations looking to leverage AI for cybersecurity should focus on: 1. Developing comprehensive AI strategies that align with their overall security objectives. 2. Ensuring high-quality data collection and management to maximize AI effectiveness. 3. Maintaining a balance between AI automation and human expertise. 4. Addressing privacy and ethical concerns associated with AI implementation. 5. Continuously evaluating and adapting AI systems to keep pace with evolving threats. Further research is needed to explore the long-term impacts of AI on cybersecurity, particularly in areas such as AI-human collaboration, the development of more robust and explainable AI models, and strategies to counter AI-powered cyber-attacks. As the digital threat landscape continues to evolve, the role of AI in cybersecurity is likely to become increasingly crucial, necessitating ongoing research and development in this field **REFERENCES** 1.

Traditional encryption methods: In the early stages of cryptography, classical methods such as Caesar ciphers and replacement ciphers were dominant, and although these techniques laid the foundation for the profession, today they are considered outdated and vulnerable to contemporary threats. 2. Symmetric encryption: Due to their effectiveness in both encrypting and decrypting data, symmetric key algorithms such as DES (Data Encryption Standard) and AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) have gained widespread use, However, there are significant administrative issues, especially with large-scale systems. 3. Public Key Infrastructure (PKI): RSA and ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography), which are examples of public key cryptography, provide a pioneering method using public and private key pairs. Digital signatures, certificate-based authentication, and secure communications have benefited from PKI (PKI) being widely used. 4. Hash Functions and Message Authentication Codes (MAC): To ensure data integrity, cryptographic hash functions such as SHA-256 and SHA-3 are required, Additional layers of security are provided by MAC algorithms such as HMAC to ensure that data is not altered while it is being transmitted. _**© 2024, IJCSMC All Rights Reserved, ZAIN Publications, Fridhemsgatan 62, 112 46, Stockholm, Sweden**_ _**89**_ Mohammad Abudalou, International Journal of Computer Science and Mobile Computing, Vol.13 Issue.1, January- 2024, pg. 88-92 5.

Many information and technology (IT) companies have shifted their operations to the cloud, which provides its users with a feature-rich cloud experience, including access to shared resources, which makes resources available when needed at lower costs. These resources may also be swiftly provided and released with minimal administrative effort, and CC provides the ability to share, manage, and store data, which is actually hosted on remote servers rather than using internal resources or personal devices [1]. Clients can use the cloud services of various programs by adopting CC rather than buying or installing the software on their own computers [3]. CC provides clients with virtualized resources using various technologies, such as web services, virtualization, applications, and operating systems [1]. The main advantages of CC can be summarized as cost reduction, increased productivity, stability, scalability easy management, and availability [4], [5]. Despite the above advantages of CC, it has given rise to various problems and challenges. Security is one of the greatest hurdles that hinder the acceptance of CC among users [1], [6]. It is a major concern that must be considered, and data security issues arise because client data and software are located on the _**Journal homepage**_ _: http://ijece.iaescore.com_ 1868  ISSN: 2088-8708 provider’s premises [7]. If suitable security measures are not provided for data operations and transmissions, then they will be at great risk [8]. Thus, cloud service providers (CSPs) must protect data, applications, and cloud infrastructure from internal and external threats. The security of cloud information depends on the implementation of suitable information security measures and countermeasures, making the creation and management of a safe cloud environment a difficult operation. Protecting user data against malicious attacks and unreliable servers is crucial. The user data that have to be secured are [3]: i) usage data: data gathered from computers; ii) private data, such as bank account and health information; iii) personally identifiable data: data that might be used to define an individual; and iv) unique device identifiers: data that can be uniquely tracked, such as IP addresses. Encryption is one of the safest methods that is used to prevent unwanted access. In CC environments, various types of encryption techniques have been used to protect user data and cloud information, which have contributed to reducing hacking to some extent. The data can be transformed into cipher text to increase their security. However, this process may lead to the loss of numerous features. Encrypted text can be obtained by using two popular techniques. The first technique is based on a safety index, which creates a secure cipher text keyword index by checking the keywords’ existence, and the second technique is based on scanning cipher text, which compares each word to ensure that the keywords are in the cipher text [3]. Numerous researchers have focused on finding various answers to the CC data security issue [9]. Further research is needed to understand the cloud’s associated security and privacy problems. This study provided a recent review of cloud security issues, challenges, and threats to cloud adoption, and encryption algorithms that are used in cloud environments. A comparison was made between the most important encryption algorithms that can be used to provide greater cloud security. The rest of this article is organized as: section 2 describes the architecture of cloud security in detail. Section 3 introduces the security issues in cloud CC. Section 4 conducts a literature review. Section 5 presents the results and discussion of the study. Section 6 provides the conclusion. **2.** **ARCHITECTURE OF CLOUD SECURITY** **2.1. Explaining cloud computing** CC is a metaphor for describing the web as a place where computing has been preinstalled and is available as a service, where data, applications, operating systems, storage, and processing capacity are all available on the web and ready to be shared among customers [2]. CC refers to a collection of data centers that connect to the internet to offer their services, and these data centers are based on the virtualization of their infrastructure [10]. CC is technologically based on infrastructure, software platform, operating system, cloud app development, database management, system and app management software, Internet, and network [2]. CC service providers are companies that provide their customers with CC resources and services that are used dynamically at the request of the customer in accordance with a particular business model. Figure 1 shows the relationship between the most common CC service providers, such as Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and IBM. Figure 1. Cloud computing Int J Elec & Comp Eng, Vol. 13, No. 2, April 2023: 1867-1879 Int J Elec & Comp Eng ISSN: 2088-8708  **2.2. Cloud deployment model** 1869 CC is classified into three types [9], [11], [12]: private, public, and hybrid cloud. Private clouds are managed and overseen only for a solitary organization, and the assets are not used by other clients, which indicates that they are protected from being accessed by unauthorized users. Public clouds are available to the general public and organizations. The assets are shared between every one of the clients. The clients pay the cloud owner depending on the service provided and the assets they utilize. CSPs manage the physical infrastructure, which is located away from the clients. Hybrid clouds are a mix of the above two types (public and private) [1], [10]. **2.3. Service models** CC provides three key services, namely, software as a service (SaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), and infrastructure as a service (IaaS) [1], [9], [11]. - IaaS: It refers to CSP hardware infrastructure, which includes networks, storage, memory, processors, and a variety of other computing resources. The resources are provided as virtualized systems that can be accessed via the internet. The essential resources are under the control of the CSP [1]. - PaaS: It provides integrated development environments, middleware, operating systems, and platform layer resources through a third-party provider who delivers hardware and software tools to users over the Internet. PaaS does not give customers control over the underlying cloud infrastructure, but only over the applications that are moved to the cloud. - SaaS: It allows consumers to use applications as a service over the internet. Users can simply use the internet to access it rather than buy, install, and maintain software. Customers pay for usage rather than ownership of the software. The CC system is divided into two sections: the front end and the back end. They communicate with each other through a network, usually over the internet. The front end is the side that cloud clients see. The clients do not normally see the back-end section, which includes network connection, cloud servers, and their applications. Figure 2 shows the categories of cloud services and the architecture of CC. Figure 2. CC service model **2.4. Characteristics of cloud computing** CC satisfies many characteristics, which are [5], [13]–[15]: - On-demand self-service: Cloud services (such as network storage, network access, and continuous monitoring of the server uptime) do not need any human managers. The clients themselves can provide, supervise, and manipulate computing resources and IT services as needed. - Resource pooling: A CSP can share CC costs and resources (such as servers, storage, database, applications, networks, and services) among a large pool of users, allowing users connected to the cloud to use data simultaneously and to share cloud services according to their requirements. - Broad network access: A user can access CC resources over the network from anywhere worldwide with an Internet connection and a device (e.g., smartphone, computer, and PDA). - Rapid elasticity: Computing services and resources can be scaled up or down quickly and flexibly as needed. - Economy: CC reduces huge IT expenses for its users. The user pays for the service used without having to invest in the computing infrastructure needed to operate and maintain the resources. No coverage or _Cloud data security and various cryptographic algorithms (Yahia Alemami)_ 1870  ISSN: 2088-8708 additional fees must be paid in addition to allocating some services for free. Figure 3 shows the characteristics of CC. Figure 3. Characteristics of CC **2.5. Challenges of cloud computing** Customers of CC services encounter a variety of challenges, which are [16]–[18]: - Regulatory compliance: Although client data is held by a service provider, clients are primarily responsible for the protection and integrity of their own information. - Data isolation: when using the cloud, data is often shared with those other clients. Although encryption is useful, it is not a cure-all. - Recovery: Although clients are unaware of the location of their data, a CSP should explain what will happen to their data and service in the event of a disaster. - Location of data: when CC is employed, data are not exactly where they are hosted. Clients are unaware of the location in which their data will be kept. - Network connection: In a cloud system, slow network connectivity causes performance bottlenecks when transferring data between data hubs and within the data center, and Internet disruption can lead to huge business losses. - I/O operations do not considerably improve performance in a virtual environment when compared to shared memory and central processing unit (CPU) time. The bulk of high-performance computing applications needs all of the links that make the application run simultaneously. - When errors occur in a cloud system, which has a wide user base, they can only be fixed in the production environment in real time. Resolving such problems may be difficult. - Cloud services must always be available. Servers should withstand distributed denial of service attacks and power outages. - Protecting the confidentiality and privacy measures of sensitive client data is the main challenge of CC because they are under the maintenance and supervision of a third party. - Abuse of the cloud services for malicious purposes. - Protect and preserve data from loss, hacking, and theft. Network security, communication level, big data storage, storage and computational performance, maintenance, edge computing web app protection, confidentiality, reliability, information integrity, access to data, authentication, and data leakage are additional issues that need to be addressed. **3.** **SECURITY ISSUES IN CLOUD** The security of a cloud data center is mostly identical to those of a noncloud data center [9], [19]. Keeping CC safe from any threats is necessary. Some privacy and security-related issues that are thought to be important for CC are [19]: Int J Elec & Comp Eng, Vol. 13, No. 2, April 2023: 1867-1879 Int J Elec & Comp Eng ISSN: 2088-8708  1871 - Malicious insiders: a malicious insider is a person who has authorized access to an organization’s network and data and uses these powers in a manner that compromises the organization’s information and information systems’ confidentiality and integrity. Most organizations are aware of this hazard because it is difficult to detect and has a remarkable effect on the organization. - Account or service hijacking: this threat arises because of fraud and software flaws. In this case, an attacker can gain access to sensitive regions on the cloud, in which he can steal permits and sensitive data. - Hypervisor vulnerabilities: a hypervisor is the most important piece of software in virtualization. Hypervisors have obvious security vulnerabilities, and remedies are still restricted and often proprietary. - Insecure interfaces and application programming interfaces (APIs): If a poor set of interfaces and APIs are used, then organizations may face security threats, such as unknown access, reuse of passwords, the transmission of content or clear text authentication, and inflexible access management or invalid authorizations. - Cyber-attacks: hacking and cyber-attacks on networks have increasingly become a grave threat in recent years. **4.** **LITERATURE REVIEW** The timely execution of encoding data is one of the most serious challenges encountered during data processing and transmission over the Internet. Focusing on privacy concerns, the researchers introduced the dynamic data encryption strategy (D2ES), a new data encryption strategy that attempts to selectively encrypt data using privacy categorization methods while adhering to time constraints. The privacy of this new method has been improved. However, concerns about maintaining the privacy of data owners are found in accordance with the report. Unencrypted data transmissions are one of the main sources of concern. The suggested method consists of two primary techniques: i) identifying data bundles in accordance with their level of privacy and ii) determining whether data bundles can be enciphered within the time constraints. The dynamic encryption determination algorithm was created to provide alternate data bundles for encipherment under varying timing constraints, and it was the fundamental algorithm underpinning the D2ES architecture. The evaluations reveal that the proposed methodology has a powerful performance [20]. users must utilize an encryption mechanism to keep their data safe in the cloud [21]. The user has no idea where their information is saved on the cloud and is concerned about its information protection. Cyber laws in every country vary. The legality and confidentiality of information are the main concerns. The researchers used homomorphic encryption, which ensures that the data is kept private. The proposed technique is tested in the public cloud of Amazon Web Services. Vijayakumar _et al._ [22] mentioned that in the current period of information technology, most organizations are moving toward the cloud to save and manage information due to decreased cost, flexibility, regular access, and invigorated programming. They pointed out that healthcare service systems are modifying mechanized stages and winding up being focused on patient-centered information. These systems exhibit an arranging empowered intermediary re-encryption strategy to solve the security flaws for the protection of patient information in healthcare fields, where this method allows authorized people to access the records for a specific timeframe. The suggested framework gives the information owner the ability to select the client who will be granted permission to search directly without disclosing his private key. In an offline state, a key generation attack is a possible threat. The researchers utilized public keyword search with proxy re-encipherment to counteract this threat, which makes keyword guessing more difficult. The Diffie-Hellman algorithm was used by the researchers to produce a shared private key between two parties. It is mostly used to exchange cryptography keys for use in symmetric encryption methods, such as advanced encryption standard (AES). They created a hybrid metaheuristic algorithm to reduce the latency, processing costs, load balancing, and energy consumption of the internet of things (IoT). Arora and Parashar [23] compared the AES, data encryption standard (DES), Blowfish, and RivestShamir-Adleman (RSA) algorithms to determine the optimum security algorithm for usage in the cloud to keep cloud information safe from hackers. The AES algorithm takes the least amount of time to execute cloud information, the Blowfish algorithm requires the least amount of memory, the DES algorithm takes the least amount of encoding time, and RSA consumes the most memory and encoding time. Singh and Sharma proposed the idea of storing information on many cloud servers utilizing encryption as opposed to putting away a whole record on a single system. For the encipherment of the section of a file in the cloud, a model that combines the AES algorithm and some components of the secure hash algorithms-1 (SHA-1) algorithm was proposed. In the proposed approach, efforts are exerted to diverge the file into distinct pieces, followed by encipherment and storage on a different cloud [24]. Lee _et al._ [25] used Heroku as a cloud system and used the AES algorithm for information security in Heroku, which relies on a managed container framework, coordinated information services, and a strong ecological system for deploying and executing modern apps. _Cloud data security and various cryptographic algorithms (Yahia Alemami)_ 1872  ISSN: 2088-8708 The AES method can be utilized for data security in accordance with the performance evaluation results. They pointed out that Heroku supports the expansion of the cloud platform because it is free. Despite Heroku being free, it can integrate with information services, and developers can construct frameworks using programming languages with Heroku. Heroku supports several programming languages, including Java, PHP, and Python. Cloud-based encryption and decryption algorithms can improve the online examination system [26]. For this process testing, they did not apply any encryption or decryption algorithms. Although online tests have been widely employed by universities and colleges at all academic levels, they do have one major drawback: the internet connection can be lost. A cutting-edge online examination system capable of overcoming the aforementioned flaw was proposed. Examinees can answer e-question papers without fear of losing Internet connection if the proposed approach is implemented. More _et al._ [27] suggested a crypto framework for secure cloud information, which combines attribute-based encryption (ABE) and byte rotation encryption algorithm (BREA) to provide additional security and protection to cloud information sharing and coordinated activities. The attributes of the information to be uploaded will be recognized by the ABE algorithm. These attributes will aid the BREA in determining the type of information to be enciphered. The BREA will execute single, multi, or hybrid phase encoding after determining the file’s information type. Following the encoding of the data, the ABE will generate a random key that will allow the user to decode the encoded text. This proposed technique has been used in cloud-based banking systems. Attar and Shahin [28] mentioned that the cloud provides many benefits for businesses and customers, such as lower costs and more flexibility. Integrity, availability, confidentiality, privacy, and confidentiality are the most common security concerns in the cloud. The AES algorithm was employed. The suggested method is divided into two parts. The first part is to load data on a cloud server, and the second part is to download data from a cloud server to the client’s PC. The security of the client’s information was examined in the two areas. The experiments were conducted by using a machine with a dual-core Intel processor running at 2.5 GHz, 4 GB of RAM, a 500 GB hard drive, and a Linux operating system. The proposed algorithm (AES) encrypts files faster and with more security than DES and Blowfish. Abdulhamid _et al._ [29] pointed out that most CC apps do not provide a high level of security, such as data protection, secrecy, and integrity. Thus, users must utilize a cloud encryption system to encrypt data before storing them in the cloud. The Blowfish encryption technique was applied in their study. The suggested encryption architecture was tested on a Microsoft Azure cloud server. Secure communication protocol hypertext transfer protocol secure (HTTPS) was used to send encrypted messages to the cloud by using C# programming language. The proposed method adds an extra layer of security by encrypting data before transferring them to the cloud. Kumar _et al._ [30] demonstrated that many IT firms and educational institutions are realizing that by simply switching to the cloud, they may instantly access used PC applications and effectively manage infrastructure resources at a low cost. An encryption technique for information security was enhanced to provide security to cloud users. The proposed technique uses a binary tree, where every node contains a letter, integer, or special character, and each link has a binary value of 0 or 1. Hackers will find that the proposed technique is difficult to use because numbers increase security while accessing information. Sajay _et al._ [31] indicated that security is the fundamental issue related to CC. In the cloud, the models of security are confidentiality, verification, information recuperation, and information integrity. The proposed technique, which is a combined algorithm to improve the security of cloud information by applying an encipherment algorithm, including homographic encipherment and Blowfish encipherment, uses Python programming and cryptography to improve the cloud security. The homographic encipherment is applied to the main layer, which is applied to the input text and is then passed to the second layer, which is the Blowfish encipherment layer. The proposed algorithm provides a security strategy and better stockpiling utilizing encipherment algorithms over the cloud architecture. The results show that if the security challenges are fixed, then small and large enterprises will be safe when storing data in the cloud. Subashanthini and Pounambal [32] proposed a method for resolving the security issue in electronic commerce in the business world and presented a unified system for storing image data in the cloud. Integer wavelet transform (IWT), chaotic maps, and the deoxyribose nucleic acid (DNA) encoding rule were combined in a three-organize picture encoding process. The proposed method employs five degrees of protection by generating five key sequences through five different chaotic maps. A grayscale image was partitioned into 8×8 blocks, and key 1 was formed by randomly selecting 8×8 blocks using a logistic map. Key 2 was created by using a line map. A tent map was used to make key 3, and a Henon map was applied to make key 4. The resulting mixed block is decoded by selecting a DNA rule using key 5, which is generated by using a sine map. The findings of several measurements and analysis metrics on the suggested work are: entropy=7.99, PSNR=9 dB, and correlation is approximately zero. Differential and brute force attacks are likewise resistant to the proposed strategy. Int J Elec & Comp Eng, Vol. 13, No. 2, April 2023: 1867-1879 Int J Elec & Comp Eng ISSN: 2088-8708  1873 Xu _et al._ [33] stated that despite the improvement of electronic healthcare systems, issues on ensuring the accuracy and protection of doctors’ recommendations to users are still found. Two algorithms based on the modified Paillier cryptosystem, truth discovery technology, and the Dirichlet distribution were proposed to protect privacy. The proposed scheme (PPMR) is a privacy-preserving online medical service recommendation schema for electronic healthcare systems that assists users in finding the right doctor. The proposed PPMR scheme is found to be secure after a security analysis. The sensitive data (for example, clients’ needs and doctors’ data) are protected in the proposed strategy. Client requests and doctor data are compared in ciphertext form in this approach. This method contains three steps: system initialization, doctor suggestion, and user feedback to determine the doctor’s reputation. Individual health data are outsourced to be stored in the cloud to ensure that patients retain ownership over their data, and the data should be encrypted and stored in a database in accordance with the information presented. A cloud-based mobile health monitoring system was developed to ensure the privacy of users’ data. The SHA 512 algorithm was used for attribute-based encoding and decoding on the basis of specific information. The proposed technology generates medicine that is appropriate for the patient. IBM-Bluemix is an IBM cloud that provides PaaS, IaaS, and SaaS to customers who want to keep their businesses running on the cloud at a cheaper cost. Bluemix provides a variety of services to keep your security up to date. ClearDb is used as a database service for storing client information [34]. Shah and Philip mentioned that authentication plays a vital role in data security. Biometrics were used for authentication to create a biometric-based cloud for online signature acknowledgment on a Windows Tablet PC, making the signature recognition system more scalable, pluggable, and faster. This process was implemented on the Microsoft Azure public cloud. Signature recognition is one of the most important study areas in the realm of biometric-based identity recognition that may be used successfully in banking applications and Internet commerce. Their study aims to promote online signature acknowledgment in banking applications, where it can be simple to reveal erroneous or fraudulent bank checks. The proposed method achieves a 90% increase in execution speed [35]. Malviya and Dave [36] pointed out that information trustworthiness and information privacy are two important things for open cloud environments. A secure data sharing scheme for dynamic groups in open cloud environments was developed. A customer can share information with others in the group by using the suggested system without jeopardizing cloud privacy. Admin, cryptographic server, and user are the three key components of the proposed system. A cloud is a place where safe data sharing is possible. The data owner module was enhanced to handle unexpected client panel operations and to prevent unauthorized users from gaining access to the system. The AES technique was used to encrypt the data, and the homomorphic (Paillier) algorithm was used to encrypt the key in the proposed work. JAVA was used to complete the task, and JSP was used to deploy the web application. The suggested approach is secure and efficient for exchanging data files in the public cloud among several users. Dong _et al._ [37] developed a framework called SecureMR that analyzes and transforms MapReduce applications to work over encoded data. Homomorphic encryption was used by SecureMR, which was assessed on a number of MapReduce benchmarks. According to Wu _et al._ [38] the medical IoT (mIoT), which is backed by the outstanding processing capacity of the cloud and the effective information collection of medicinal sensors, is one of the most prominent breakthroughs. Security remains a major concern in the mIoT because the information is transmitted over an open network. Although encryption techniques may help to maintain patient privacy, they may impede future retrieval of the encrypted data. Public-key encryption with keyword search was proposed to overcome this restriction. The guessing attack in information search was identified as a severe security risk. A reliable public key verified encryption method with a designated tester (CL-dPAEKS) was proposed to address these issues. This method is suitable for the mIoT and contains polynomial-time algorithms. CL-dPAEKS can withstand all types of attacks and is relatively secure. Namasudra [39] proposed an efficient and secure CC data sharing access control model based on ABE, a distributed hash table (DHT) network, and identity-based timed-release encryption (IDTRE). Information was encoded by using client characteristics, and the encoded information was divided into encapsulated and extracted ciphertexts. IDTRE was used to encrypt the decryption key, and the key’s ciphertext was combined with the retrieved ciphertext to generate the ciphertext shares. The DHT network was used to distribute the ciphertext shares, and the ciphertext was stored on cloud servers. The findings indicate that the proposed method is safe, efficient, and has a remarkable effect on the IoT. Sarode and Bhalla [40] indicated that mobile CC (MCC) is a fast-developing invention at present. Data protection and security are important considerations when using a mobile device. Network security, web application security, information access, authentication, authorization, data confidentiality, and data breach are all concerns of MCC’s security. Mobile devices lack sufficient storage and processing speed. Thus, a strategy that uses AES and RSA was devised to provide flawless security and to improve the security of the mobile cloud. The AES algorithm was used initially because it is faster than RSA in terms of encoding. The AES will convert the original text into a quick response (QR) code during the encoding stage. This QR code _Cloud data security and various cryptographic algorithms (Yahia Alemami)_ 1874  ISSN: 2088-8708 will be scanned with the help of the decipherment technique, and the cipher text will be converted to a QR code by using the RSA algorithm. The AES algorithm will then decode the QR code back to plain text. In the mobile cloud, the proposed technique ensures information security and integrity of data and applications. Cloud-based electronic health record (EHR) technology has revolutionized health care. A secure EHR searching approach that relies on conjunctive keyword searches and proxy re-encoding for information transfer between medical organizations has been provided. It investigates public key encryption with conjunctive keyword search to encrypt the original material and store it on the cloud, ensuring information security while allowing for searchability. The identity-based access control methodology and proxy re-encoding methods are implemented to ensure the validity of access and the privacy of the original material [41]. Hiemenz and Krämer [42] presented a dynamic searchable symmetric encipherment method permitting clients to safely store geospatial information in the cloud. Geospatial information frequently includes critical data, such as urban infrastructures. The genuine geospatial records are enciphered by utilizing the AES algorithm to guarantee secrecy. Searchable symmetric encipherment is appropriate in geospatial document stockpiling, and the suggested method can protect users’ information. Chauhan _et al._ [43] demonstrated many smart learning strategies that aid in the enhancement of the smart virtual interactive environment for work (SVIEW). The proposed method aims to increase efficiency at SRM University’s workplace, improve student learning, save power, reduce considerable time, and make life easier for everyone (students, staff, and the board). SVIEW is customizable and can be used at various institutions. In the proposed work, a teacher’s fingerprint is used to control the study hall’s electrical equipment. The system’s goals are to make the university smart and assist lecturers in resolving the concerns raised in the university. AES, which takes less time to encrypt and decrypt, is used to encrypt data. Xiong and Shi [44] developed two new safe reversible data hiding over encrypted image techniques. The first technique is reversible data hiding by homomorphic encipherment, and the second technique is reversible data hiding in an enciphered domain. These techniques are suitable for preserving image privacy and transferring extra information in cloud data services, where the EIGamal algorithm is employed. Cybersecurity assaults have undermined clients’ information privacy and protection in medical cyberphysical systems (MCPSs). Conventional standard encipherment algorithms for information protection (EHR for MCPS), were created depending on the system architecture as opposed to the viewpoint of clients. A safe methodology for data stockpiling and conveying was proposed. This method comprises a selective encipherment algorithm combined with fragmentation and dispersion to ensure information security and protection. The main idea of the SE algorithm is to splinter the digital information in a manner that makes various information parts related [45]. CC is one of the most researched topics in IT, and cloud information security is one of the top concerns for any organization that considers shifting to the cloud. Goyal and Kant [46] created and tested a variety of algorithms for securing cloud data, including AES, SHA-1 (hashing method), and elliptic curve cryptography (ECC). Every encipherment and decipherment procedure in the proposed technique uses two different keys. Kumar and Roberts [47] proposed a new architecture based on digital signatures as a means of reducing the economic denial of sustainability (EDoS) from the cloud. Kumar and Shafi [48] used a modified RSA technique to increase the security for cloud-stored data. Teng _et al._ [49] presented a modified AES by using master choreography and column mixing. Experiments were conducted on the Hadoop platform. Abroshan [50] combined an elliptic curve-based technique with an enhanced Blowfish algorithm. The security and performance are improved by using the two techniques to encrypt the data. Awan _et al._ [51] proposed an improved 128 AES method to accelerate the encryption process. The improved technique uses less power, better load balancing, and improved trust and resource management on the network. Kumar _et al._ [52] developed a novel approach using the autonomic resource provisioning and scheduling (ARPS) framework combined with the spider monkey optimization (SMO) algorithm. The effectiveness of the proposed approach was assessed by using the CloudSim framework. It achieves good results in terms of processing time, cost, and energy consumption. Mata _et al._ [53] utilized hybrid cryptographic techniques (AES and Blowfish) in their study. Progressively introducing more complicated functions increases the security of data storage in CC. Dubey _et al._ [54] aimed to allocate the best possible resources for IoT applications by combining the features of two metaheuristic-based methodologies, cuckoo search optimization (CSO), and particle swarm optimization (PSO). The simulation outcomes show that the suggested hybrid algorithm may allocate the services more effectively. The computational results in [55] show that the improved binary PSO (BPSO) algorithm, which is based on a transfer function, is more effective in optimizing several quality-of-service metrics, such as makespan time, energy consumption, and execution cost. Goyal and Kant [46] devised a new hybrid algorithm for protecting cloud data and used it in practice. The proposed algorithm combines AES, SHA-1 (a hashing technique), and ECC. Khakim _et al._ [56] secured the password using the MD5 algorithm and Int J Elec & Comp Eng, Vol. 13, No. 2, April 2023: 1867-1879 Int J Elec & Comp Eng ISSN: 2088-8708  1875 encrypted the data using AES with a key length of 256 bits. The proposed method prevents anyone to hack the login data in the cloud. Orobosade _et al._ [57] proposed a method using ECC as the following encryption technique with an AES key, and AES key as the first-level data encryption process before storing data in the cloud.

International data encryption algorithm (IDEA), AES, RSA, Blowfish, and DES algorithms are compared to determine the best security algorithm. The assessment results are shown in Table 2. Table 2 shows that RSA is an asymmetric algorithm, and IDEA, AES, Blowfish, and DES are symmetric algorithms. RSA and IDEA are less secure than AES, Blowfish, and DES). In this study, the AES algorithm takes the least amount of time to encipher cloud information, the Blowfish algorithm requires the least amount of memory space, and the AES algorithm can be used for encrypting huge amounts of data. The AES is faster than other algorithms and is the best algorithm in terms of authentication parameters. The RSA consumes the most memory and requires maximum encipherment time. Figure 4 shows the comparison of encryption algorithms with respect to the security level, data encipherment capacity, authentication, memory utilization, and encryption time. _Cloud data security and various cryptographic algorithms (Yahia Alemami)_ 1876  ISSN: 2088-8708 Table 2.

Cloud information security is one of the top concerns for any organization that considers shifting to the cloud. Therefore, researchers mostly focus on this topic. Encryption is one of the safest solutions for blocking unauthorized access. Different encryption techniques are used in cloud environments to secure cloud data, which contributes to reducing hacking to some extent. This study provided a recent review of cloud security issues, challenges to cloud adoption, and encryption algorithms that are used in cloud environments. The framework and techniques utilized in a number of previous studies were summarized. A literature review was conducted in the field of cloud data security in which the encryption algorithms of RSA, AES, DES, Blowfish, and IDEA were compared, to find the optimal security algorithm for cloud data protection. The results show that RSA is an asymmetric algorithm, and IDEA, AES, Blowfish, and DES are symmetric algorithms. RSA and IDEA are less secure than AES, Blowfish, and DES, and the Blowfish algorithm requires the least amount of memory space. The AES algorithm can be used for encrypting huge amounts of data. The AES is faster than other algorithms and is the best algorithm in terms of authentication parameters. The RSA consumes the most memory and requires maximum execution time. The researchers suggest the use of hybrid encryption algorithms, such as AES and Blowfish, to obtain more security and complexity for hackers. **REFERENCES** [1] M. Ali, S. U. Khan, and A. V.

Numerous applications have been proposed to enable vehicles to share real-time and non-real ­content [3] . The real-time applications may include event data, sensory information, and multi-media streams. Whereas non-real-time data consists of time-insensitive messages, web browsing, and file transfers. Despite improvements in technology, vehicular networks still face numerous challenges. According to World Health Organization (WHO), 1.35 million people die every year due to road accidents. Advancements in automobile communication technologies have boosted the growth of ITS and the Internet of Things (IoT) to address various issues, such as road and rail hazards, traffic congestion, secure authentication, and message dissemination over the ­network [4][–][7] . Recent years have seen Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) as an evolving technology of ITS that has gained significant attention. These vehicles are usually fitted with various kinds of onboard resources, such as sensors, radars, cameras, storage devices, event recorders, etc., to perform different actions, e.g., object detection, congestion monitoring, path finding, and so ­on [8][,][9] . The AVs are expected to capture large volumes of data to analyze it and make real-time intelligent decisions in response to the surrounding events. For instance, the sensors fitted with AVs capture gigabytes of data that need to be processed with complex machine learning algorithms to deduce logical results. To achieve communication efficiency, storage, and high-end processing, 5/6G technologies and Road Side Units (RSUs) connected with Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) servers can be ­leveraged [10] . RSUs receive all the data sent by the vehicles where MEC servers run machine learning techniques to generate useful ­predictions [11] . In ITS, different nodes work together and share data. For instance, RSUs generate alerts in case of any unusual incident so that the vehicles approaching from a far distance are informed in advance to avoid any accidents. However, it is important to ensure data privacy so that malicious users may not modify the message, mislead the network, or generate false alarms resulting in road ­fatalities [12][,][13] . In the past few years, numerous efforts have been made to develop services to ensure safety, security, and navigation among vehicles. Recently, the blockchain has emerged as a promising technology to address the security issues in centralized ­systems [14] . Blockchain is a decentralized peer-to-peer data structure that allows records to be stored in a ledger in a manner that cannot be ­altered [15] . Due to its decentralized nature, blockchain technology has eliminated the need for a central authority 1COMSATS University Islamabad, Abbottabad Campus, Abbottabad, Pakistan. 2OTEHM, Manchester Metropolitan University, Manchester, UK.

The majority of the nodes make the decision to add data in the form of a block to the blockchain, rather than relying on a centralized controller resulting into single point of ­failure [15] . Blockchain technology keeps track of all types of transactions made in a network in a provably secure manner. Blockchain has a disruptive impact on various industries including the manufacturing sector, banking, healthcare, finance, and transportation. With the recent applications in vehicular networks, blockchain technology can enable a smart transportation system that is decentralized, trusted, and secure without any ­intermediary [12] . The AVs can take full benefit of blockchain that ensures strong interconnections, and execution of smart contract-enabled transactions for certain events. Moreover, V2I communication is a potential solution to enable cooperative intelligence of AVs contributing to improving services and travelling. Several recent works have explored the use of blockchain technology in vehicular networks. The authors ­in [16] ­and [17] proposed a secure scheme for inter-vehicular communication using blockchain. Kang et al _._ [18] presented a blockchain-based peer-to-peer electricity trading system known as PETCON to improve secure electricity trading among Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs). Huang et al _._ [19] proposed a blockchain-based trading model called Lightning Network and Smart Contract (LNSC) consisting of scheduling, registration, authentication, and charging phases. It also stores the transaction data between electric vehicles and charging stations on the blockchain network while using smart contracts to facilitate an automatic trading process. Cebe et al _._ [20] discussed how the blockchain can be applied in the post-accident investigation process. Their work provides a mechanism using which the data can be stored and shared only with the party conducting the accident investigation. The use of blockchain technology in vehicular networks helps in improving the security and authenticity of data. However, the conventional consensus algorithms can cause unavoidable delays and excessive computations in block confirmation due to which timely message dissemination becomes difficult and throughput is reduced. To address these issues, we propose a Vehicular network Based Consensus Algorithm (VBCA), to secure the data shared within a vehicular network using a consortium blockchain. Our model is inspired by the Raft consensus mechanism presented ­in [21], however, we performed certain customizations that make the proposed algorithm different from the original Raft algorithm. In the Raft algorithm, the voting process takes place for leader election and all the follower nodes are the potential candidates. A follower may become a candidate node for leader election process after random election time out. The candidate votes itself and send request to other followers for voting. If followers have not voted in the current term they vote ‘yes’, otherwise they vote ‘no’. Once the majority of the followers say ‘yes’, the candidate becomes the leader. Other candidates revert to followers. The candidates get votes in a first come first serve fashion. A leader can serve for two terms. On the contrary, in the proposed algorithm, the leader election process begins with the selection of random list of candidate nodes, on the condition that a candidate node should not have remained a candidate node in the previous term. This makes our candidate selection process different from the Raft. After the candidate nodes are chosen, the proposed scheme performs the leader selection among the candidate nodes based on a Verifiable Random Function (VRF) [22], which is different in the Raft where the majority voting is utilized. However, the voting process has to be repeated in Raft in case of split decision. In addition, the proposed scheme separates the process of transaction confirmation and block confirmation that helps to increase the decentralization of the system. By separating these processes, it may be more difficult for a single entity to control the confirmation of transactions or blocks, thus increasing the overall security and reliability of the system. Vehicles being part of a public blockchain network can send and receive data (transactions) via the nearest RSU, whereas the RSU acting as a _leader_ in a private blockchain verifies and appends the set of transactions in the form of a block to the blockchain ledger. The leader RSU is selected securely using the smart contract in the proposed consensus algorithm. To timely send the message and to increase the throughput over the network, the transaction pool stores the latest transactions that are waiting to be appended to the blockchain ledger. The main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows: - We propose a VBCA algorithm using smart contracts to improve the network throughput in a blockchainbased vehicular network. - The smart contract mechanism is used to ensure decentralization by letting multiple RSUs append a block in a ledger. A leader selection process is also proposed to ensure the decentralization in block creation. This also addresses the selfish mining problem. - We have also reduced the transaction latency by proposing the separation of transaction confirmation and block creation process. - The proposed technique demonstrates improvement in results when compared with the state-of-the-art mechanisms in terms of throughput and the number of blocks created per node in the vehicular network while ensuring decentralization. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. \"Related work\" section discusses the related work. The system architecture is explained in \"System architecture\" section. The proposed consensus algorithm is discussed in \"Security analysis\" section. Achievements, limitations, and future research directions evaluates the proposed model. Finally, \"Conclusion\" section concludes the paper. **Related work** In recent years, blockchain technology has been applied in numerous application domains, such as product lifestyle ­management [23], smart tracking and ­tracing [24], and smart transportation, to name a few. Blockchain application on vehicular networks is relatively a new area of research and few works exist in that direction. In the existing literature, there is no standard categorization of blockchain based schemes for vehicular networks. **Scientific Reports** |     (2023) 13:4412 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-31442-w Vol:.(1234567890) 2 www.nature.com/scientificreports/ In this section, we present some of the recent works on the application of blockchain for vehicular networks. We categorize the works based on the type of blockchain, consensus algorithms, and applications. Later, at the end of this section we present a comparative summary of the literature in Table 1. **Public blockchain based solutions in vehicular networks.** Shrestha et al _._ [25] proposed an approach for secure message dissemination among vehicles using a local blockchain. The trust weight of every message and vehicle is stored as a transaction in the blockchain using the Proof of Work (PoW) consensus algorithm. The cars equipped with the highest computational power participated in the mining process. The RSUs were responsible for authentication and providing location certificates to the vehicles within their communication range. The paper proposed the maintenance of a separate blockchain for each region to increase scalability. However, the paper did not address the block propagation delay that occurs due to the increase in the number of vehicles in a local blockchain. Moreover, the PoW algorithm used for mining can only process seven transactions per second, which are less for delay-sensitive vehicular communications. Yang et al _._ [26] developed a model for secure yet reliable communication and trust management system for vehicular networks. The study aims to improve the miner selection presented ­in [25] by limiting the number of nodes. If a vehicle sends a message to another vehicle, its rating is computed and submitted to RSU. The RSU ranks the vehicle on the blockchain according to the respective ratings. All RSUs serve as nodes and a consensus is reached to add the block to the chain using a joint PoW and Proof-of-Stake consensus algorithm. The integrity and confidentiality of the proposed model using blockchain are achieved, but privacy is still an issue as vehicle identification numbers serve as a public key identifier. Moreover, the size of the rating packet is greater compared to the message packet resulting in the communication overhead. ­In [27], the authors experimented with the NS3 simulator to evaluate the performance of the blockchain network in the presence of a selfish miner. Experimental results depict that the block receive time has increased from 10 to 19 min. **Consortium blockchain based solutions in vehicular networks.** A consortium blockchain is presented ­in [28] for secure and efficient data sharing amongst vehicles and RSUs. The use of smart contracts ensured access control on RSUs. In addition, the implementation of a reputation-based mechanism by applying a ‘three weight subjective model’ ensured the integrity of shared data. Proof of storage and PoW consensus algorithms are used to store data securely and to generate valid blocks, respectively. The reputation system proposed ­in [28] improves the probability of detecting the misbehavior of vehicles by up to 70%. Compared to the previous ­work [25], the proposed ­scheme [28] showed better results in terms of security. However, the authors ignored the latency and propagation delay of blocks, which is critical to make the model practical for the real-world scenario. ­In [29], the authors aimed to reduce the resource consumption to increase the system utility for the traffic signal control mechanism in consortium blockchain. Performance evaluation of the proposed work indicated a decrease in computational cost with the implementation of a smart contract. However, the use of Elgamal encryption can result in higher latency in the network, not discussed in the evaluations. **Incentive based consensus algorithms.** The study ­in [30] implemented delegated proof of stake to work out issues like miner’s voting collusion and double-spending attack. The reputation score of each RSU is evaluated by the trusted authority on a blockchain.

To encourage the standby miners to actively verify the blocks, contract ­theory [30] is implemented to distribute the reward amongst the miners. After the addition of each block, the new active miner is selected. However, such an approach can delay the processing of the incoming transactions, thereby making it quite impractical to deploy the system in vehicular networks. Li et al _._ [31] proposed a scheme that allows vehicles to forward announcement messages without compromising privacy. The authors introduced a model known as CreditCoin having a consensus algorithm that confirms 100 transactions in an overall of 192 ms to append a block in the blockchain. The CreditCoin exhibited improved performance in terms of throughput and latency compared to the previous works, e.g., [30] ­and [32] . The proposed framework is employed for the post-accident analysis and it did not take into account the mobility issue of vehicles. **Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance based consensus algorithms.** In [32], the authors presented a secure data caching scheme that considers a message’s popularity and scope at RSUs using hierarchal blockchains. Two layers in the hierarchal blockchain maintained the ledgers. The paper aims to achieve low latency by using a ‘Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance’ (PBFT) consensus algorithm on both the proposed layers of blockchain. The information is disseminated in the network according to the message priority. Simulation results indicated improved performance over the conventional blockchain system in terms of system failure rate, overall utility, and low latency. The research presented ­in [33] discussed the use of 5G technology with blockchain in vehicular ad hoc networks. The work focused on applying the PBFT consensus algorithm to speed up the transaction confirmation. However, the work lacks the evaluations or performance comparisons of the implemented consensus algorithm. The primary focus of the ­studies [34] ­and [35] is to protect the privacy of vehicles where RSUs are maintaining the blockchain ledger by using the PBFT consensus algorithm. The researchers ­in [35] have proposed a solution using PBFT to ensure a more secure environment for vehicles to establish trust levels. The study ­in [36] proposed a blockchain based model of vehicular edge computing networks (VECNets). The proposed model used PBFT as a consensus mechanism which has high transaction performance compared ­to [15] . The miners are the set of preselected RSUs which makes the network semi decentralized. The performance of the overall network focused more on the incentive mechanism where a vehicle with good ratings is more trustworthy. In [37], the authors presented a variant of the PBFT consensus algorithm known as Proof of Driving (PoD). The fair selection of honest miners from a large pool of miners is proposed based on the service standard scoring method. The performance evaluation of the proposed model has shown the number of nodes being selected but the impact of throughput of the proposed network model is not evaluated. The research presented ­in [38] focuses on secure and efficient data sharing amongst the internet of vehicles by proposing a consensus algorithm Score Grouping-PBFT (SG-PBFT). Mainly the SG-PBFT relies on the basic PBFT consensus mechanism but with the scoring criteria which makes the algorithm efficient and reduces the communication overhead. The throughput of the network has shown better performance. The proposed consensus process is highly dependent on the primary node making it inclined towards centralization. **Custom consensus algorithms.** The branched blockchain concept proposed in the ­study [39] is a lightweight decentralized ledger system that easily integrates the recent block with an existing P2P network. To improve the lightweight property, the block maintenance design of this framework estimates the number of active and inactive blocks in the network and maintains only active blocks rather than complete blocks. It enables the network to combine all these active blocks into a single lightweight blockchain, allowing it to be used even by low-powered vehicles and devices at the physical layer. The study misses the details of PDP consensus mechanisms that are applied to the presented model. Vehicle to vehicle communication and calculation of the trust level of messages received by other vehicles is the main aim of the research ­in [40] . Proof of Event (PoE) is implemented to accelerate the message dissemination as a two-way process. RSUs collect the messages, compute the score, and broadcast the results to surrounding vehicles. The performance of PoE has been compared with the PoW and Proof of Activity (PoA). The results showed that the synchronization of blocks in PoE is better than in PoW. However, storing the information of all the events can lead to a scalability issue which is not discussed ­in [40] . Wagner et al _._ [41] developed a variant of the PoW consensus algorithm for block creation in which the platoon leader selects the miner with more computational power. Simulation results indicated that the system could process 100 transactions in 200 s. However, the PoW requires greater computation time and is inefficient to be deployed for vehicular networks. Moreover, the paper did not illustrate the procedure to re-elect a platoon leader. Furthermore, the information is not managed globally. A selfish miner in a blockchain network causes the other miners to use more computing resources, thereby significantly affecting the system performance. **Blockchain based solutions for IoT.** In [42], a Lightweight Scalable Blockchain (LSB) has been proposed with the custom consensus algorithm known as a distributed consensus algorithm. The cluster head is responsible for verifying the transaction and storing it in a blockchain ledger after waiting for a specific amount of time. The results compared with ­Bitcoin [15] in terms of throughput indicated improved performance in terms of transactions per second. However, the proposed system has a limitation that over time, it moves toward centralized block mining. Table 1 presents a summary of selected schemes discussed in the literature review. **System architecture.** This section discusses the major components of the proposed system and the layered architecture. We define two types of nodes as (a) Stationary nodes and (b) Mobile nodes. As shown in Fig. 1, stationary nodes are the RSUs connected with high-power edge servers. Each stationary node is providing geographic coverage to a specific region on the map, and all stationary nodes are interconnected via backhaul **Scientific Reports** |     (2023) 13:4412 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-31442-w Vol:.(1234567890) 4 www.nature.com/scientificreports/ **Figure 1.** Vehicular blockchain architecture. links. It is the responsibility of a stationary node to append a block to the blockchain, and a copy of the blockchain is stored by all the stationary nodes in the ­network [43] . A mobile node captures event data with its sensors, e.g., accidents, congestion, road condition, etc., and sends the data to the nearest stationary node. Due to the P2P network, the vehicles have more reliable connections to the nearby RSUs by using the Dedicated Short Range Communication protocol (DSRC) [1] . Vehicles and RSUs communicate within their specific range using DSRC which reduces the latency between the communicating peers. The proposed consensus algorithm runs on the edge servers to append the validated transaction in the blockchain stored on the edge servers. Since the vehicles are equipped with different types of sensors, e.g., autonomous vehicles can be equipped with cameras, radars, etc., the large volumes of data are received by the edge servers. Based on the collected data, various statistics and machine learning tools can be applied to train the models to generate various predictions for different applications. For example, by applying predictive learningbased approaches, it would be possible to predict the expected load on various sections of the transportation network during a certain time window. The predicted information can be stored in a separate blockchain and shared among all the stationary nodes through which the vehicles can query the information. The working of the proposed system is divided into following layers. **Application layer.** The application layer facilitates the end users (vehicles) to perform general input/output operations in the system. The user input is passed to the contract layer where the smart contract is called to check the user authorization and data access controls. **Contract layer.** This layer validates the authentication of vehicles and stationary nodes which are interacting with each other via blockchain and deploys the smart contract. The logic embedded in the smart contract once executed cannot be reversed. **Consensus layer.** The consensus algorithm uses mathematical rules to establish trust amongst the nodes in the network. All the stationary nodes that are RSUs connected with servers are maintaining the same copy of the ledger across the network using the consensus algorithm. The RSUs are distributed entities responsible for managing the ledgers of a region for a blockchain thus reducing the network traffic overhead. At present, there are many consensus algorithms of blockchain to achieve a domain-specific objective. In our research, we proposed a custom consensus algorithm discussed in “Security analysis” section. **Network layer.** All nodes in the network are connected in a hybrid P2P manner without any central authority. Every node uses a discovery protocol to find its nearest neighbor RSU to establish links and exchange messages. The key management and cryptographic algorithms that are used to prevent attacks are also part of a network layer. **Data layer.** This layer is incharge of managing the transactions and blocks in the ledger. Hash function, timestamp, and Merkle tree ­structure [44] are applied to ensure the integrity and security of the data. The proposed system is based on consortium blockchain having the advantages of both public and private blockchain. The network is public for vehicles to join with the public key pair issued by CA. This is to ensure integrity and authenticity in the vehicular network. The consensus amongst the stationary nodes to maintain the consistent ledger is based on a private blockchain. **Scientific Reports** |     (2023) 13:4412 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-31442-w 5 Vol.:(0123456789) www.nature.com/scientificreports/ **Vehicle registration.** Vehicles acquire the public key pair from CA by fulfilling the requirements. CA registers the vehicle and generates the public key pair. On first interaction with the stationary node, the vehicle submits the public key pair with certificates. The stationary node verifies the public key pair from the global certification authority and sends it over the network to store the public key pair. **Hybrid peer‑to‑peer network.** The proposed network architecture is different from traditional blockchain by being P2P and distributed architecture as shown in Fig. 2. The proposed system is a hybrid P2P making a stationary node a central access point for the vehicles available in its range. Only the transactions that are verified by the leader stationary node are propagated to the other stationary nodes. Finally, the confirmed transactions are broadcasted by the leader to other stationary nodes, and subsequently across the whole network. **Proposed methodology.** First, we present some necessary assumptions as a basis of the proposed methodology: (a) Cryptographic primitives (for instance, encryption schemes and hash functions) provide a secure communication channel between entities (vehicle to RSU and RSU to RSU). (b) A malicious node is not able to compromise half of the nodes in the network. This is a reasonable assumption in practice. (c) RSUs and CA are equipped with hardware having high computation power. Any information sent by the mobile nodes to stationary nodes is considered as a transaction. The transactions are created by the On-Board Units (OBUs) of the vehicles. All the new transactions are digitally signed by the mobile nodes and propagated to the nearby stationary node. Blockchain technology relies on Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) for transaction verification. As considered by earlier ­research [25], we assume that all the vehicles are registered with a Vehicular Authority (VA) and every vehicle and RSU is allotted with the public key pair. A vehicle creates a transaction Tx by encrypting the following: message data, time stamp at which the message was generated, and the hash of the message data. The encrypted transaction is then sent to the stationary node in the range of the respective vehicle. The stationary node uses the public key of the vehicle to decrypt the transaction to get hash value, and then generates the hash of the original received message. If the generated hash value matches with the hash value sent by the vehicle, the transaction is validated. Once validated, the transaction is added into a transaction pool by the leader RSU, as well as simultaneously relayed to other stationary nodes. This ensures the quick spread of information in case of any emergency event. **VBCA consensus algorithm.** This section explains the proposed VBCA algorithm for blockchain based vehicular networks. The consensus algorithm is implemented only at the stationary node level and is further divided into sub-components explained subsequently. **Leader RSU selection.** As shown in Fig. 3, a stationary node can transition between three states in the consensus process, which are: follower, candidate, or a leader. The stationary nodes are synchronized via a smart contract. The leader selection process is illustrated in Algorithm 1. Initially, a list of all stationary nodes is obtained (Line 1). The list of candidate nodes is selected randomly via using a smart contract among all the follower nodes (Line 2). A selected candidate node must not have remained as a candidate node in the previous term (Line 2). Once the candidate nodes are selected for the leader selection process, the leader is chosen based on a Verifiable Random Function (VRF) [22] amongst the candidate nodes. Each candidate has a pair of public and a private key. Given that the value of Q is a seed string and is known to the entire network, the candidate **Figure 2.** Hybrid peer-to-peer structure. **Scientific Reports** |     (2023) 13:4412 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-31442-w Vol:.(1234567890) 6 www.nature.com/scientificreports/ **Figure 3.** Leader selection process. calculates the values (Y, p) = VRF(Pr, Q), where p is the proof of work performed by the node. Each candidate node is required to calculate the value pair (Y, p). The first candidate node that computes the lowest value of Y than a threshold is selected as leader for the current term (Line 3). The leader then creates a block and propagates the block over the network of stationary nodes. By using the proof p and public key of the leader node, any candidate node can verify that Y is computed correctly or not. **Block generation.** The block generation takes place after the leader selection. Algorithm 2 shows the block generation process. - Initializations (Line 1 − Line 2): The transactions that are validated are added to the transaction pool (TxPool), and the added transactions are sorted according to the timestamps. - In Line 3–Line 6, the sorted transactions are picked by the elected leader of the term. The elected leader picks 10 transactions from transaction pool based on first in first out structure. The transactions, timestamp, hashes of transactions, smallest value of Y, and hash of previous block are then encrypted by using the private key of a leader and the block is broadcasted to the rest of RSU nodes. The follower nodes validate the block by decrypting the block with leader’s public key that is known to all the RSUs node and verify the leadership by verifying the value of Y. After the verification of block, RSU node appends the block into its ledger and sends acknowledgement to the leader. The leader waits for the acknowledgement from the follower nodes according to heartbeat timeout. - In case the ‘if statement’ of Line 3 is false, the leader selection process in Line 7 executes. **Scientific Reports** |     (2023) 13:4412 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-31442-w 7 Vol.:(0123456789) www.nature.com/scientificreports/ _Performance evaluation._ To the best of our knowledge, there does not exist any special purpose simulator to implement blockchain on vehicular networks. Network Simulator 3 (NS-3) has been widely used for simulating the different types of networks with customized requirements and parameters. Inspired by the study presented ­in [42], we found NS-3 an appropriate candidate for our proposed work due to the availability of support libraries addressing the custom requirements of blockchain. We have simulated the proposed VBCA algorithm using smart contracts over a vehicular network. The proposed system is compared with the following consensus algorithms: (a) Distributed Time Consensus (DTC) [42], (b) Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) [32], and (c) ­PoW [25] . The simulation parameters are discussed in Table 2. The following performance parameters are used in the comparisons: (a) block confirmation time, (b) throughput, (c) transaction latency, and (d) confirmed transactions. The time from block creation to its confirmation is known as block confirmation time. Throughput is the number of confirmed transactions per second. A large number of transactions are generated over the period, but we are considering only the confirmed transactions in the results. The average transaction latency for _T_ transactions is given as: Avg. transaction latency = [1] Generated timei − Confirmation timei. (1) T i Generated timei − Confirmation timei. **Impact of time on throughput.** Figure 4 shows the evaluation results based on throughput. As indicated, the proposed VBCA exhibits better performance than the related schemes. This is due to the leader selection process that reduces the overall transaction confirmation time. When the transaction is confirmed by the leader stationary node, the remaining nodes do not have to wait for the block creation. Messages created per second by vehicular networks need to be confirmed before a specific deadline. However, the PoW scheme only confirms a maximum of 7 transactions per second because of the slow mining algorithm, which negatively impacts the throughput. |Parameter|Value(s)| |---|---| |Total nodes|50| |Vehicles (mobile nodes)|34| |RSUs (stationary nodes)|16| |Miners|16| |Leader|1 (per round)| |Candidates for leader selection|4| |Genesis block transactions|10| |Transaction rate|5000| |Transaction size|200 Kb| |Block size|2 MB| |Heartbeat timeout|50 ms| |Total blocks|50| **Table 2.** Simulation parameters and values. **Scientific Reports** |     (2023) 13:4412 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-31442-w Vol:.(1234567890) 8 www.nature.com/scientificreports/ **Figure 4.** Transactions confirmed per second (throughput). **Transaction latency at stationary node.** Figure 5 shows the transaction latency at each node. The proposed VBCA exhibits better performance than the existing schemes, except for the PBFT. The transaction latency heavily depends on the nature of the network. The PBFT is a fully private network, therefore, it has a smaller transaction confirmation time. Alternatively, PoW has greater latency because the transaction has to be confirmed by every peer in the network. We observe that the transaction latency of VBCA at each stationary node is comparatively low because of the consortium blockchain where only the leader stationary node confirms the transaction into the pool. **Impact of block creation.** We set the number of transactions for the genesis block creation to be equal to ten. The genesis block is static and is the first block of a blockchain network. Different leaders create a different number of blocks to ensure the system is decentralized. Each subsequent block constitutes 10 transactions. The proposed VBCA creates the block in the maximum threshold time of 0.05 s. On the contrary, the mechanism used by ­DTC [42] initially increases the block creation time for a certain interval until the trusted block creator is selected, after which the block time is fixed at 0.1 s. Figure 6 shows that the block creation time for VBCA becomes constant after almost 20 blocks. This is due to the non-selfish nature of the block creation process in the proposed scheme, where the block must be created within a fixed threshold set for a heartbeat to prevent the selfish mining attack. The block creation times for the remaining schemes contained larger values and are hence not shown in the graph. **Figure 5.** Transaction latency at each RSU. **Scientific Reports** |     (2023) 13:4412 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-31442-w 9 Vol.:(0123456789) www.nature.com/scientificreports/ **Figure 6.** Block creation time. **Impact of transaction rate on confirmed transactions.** We have evaluated different consensus schemes against the transaction rate. The results in Fig. 7 show that VBCA has a higher transaction confirmation rate compared to other approaches. This is due to the Hybrid P2P structure of the proposed scheme where after the validation of the transaction, the respective stationary node forwards the transaction to the leader node, thereby avoiding the long process for validation by every single node in the ­network [25] . **Impact of number of blocks per RSU.** The stationary nodes that manage the ledger by appending the latest block to the ledger must be carefully selected to ensure system decentralization. Figure 8 indicates that VBCA performs block creation at almost every node, thus making the system decentralized. On the contrary, ­PoW [25] selects the node with greater resources leading to the greater consumption of network resources, centralization, and creating more orphan blocks. Alternatively, the DTC ­scheme [42] is trust table-based making it more centralized and exposing the system to a single point of failure due to attacks. Better decentralization in VBCA is achieved by not allowing the consecutive selection of the same leader, thus giving chance to other nodes for block creation. **Transaction confirmation time for block.** Figure 9 shows the transaction confirmation time per block. The time when the leader confirms the transaction by broadcasting to the network and adding the transaction to the pool is referred to as transaction confirmation time. The transaction confirmation time per block is given as follows: **Figure 7.** Variation in transaction rate. **Scientific Reports** |     (2023) 13:4412 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-31442-w Vol:.(1234567890) 10 www.nature.com/scientificreports/ **Figure 8.** Block creation per node. **Figure 9.** Transaction confirmation for block. Transaction conf . time per block = TAddi + Waitpool timei + Ack timei. (2) TAddi + Waitpool timei + Ack timei. i Waitpool Time = Pick timestampi(Tx)−Recvd time stampi(Tx) (3) Here, TAddi is the time when a leader selects the transaction from the pool to add to a block and the block is propagated to other stationary nodes to append into their respective ledgers. Moreover, the parameter AckTimei is the time the leader waits until the acknowledgement from each stationary node is received and the block is added. As we can observe from the results, the existing approaches take more time for transaction confirmation due to their resource-intensive consensus algorithm. Such delays result in an overall increase in network latency and throughput. In addition, the block creation process in the consensus algorithms takes the system towards centralization which violates the essence of blockchain technology. The proposed algorithm separates the transaction confirmation and block generation process to reduce the transaction confirmation latency. The block creation process is also decentralized. Moreover, the proposed algorithm uses a smart contract for the candidate selection to reduce the heartbeat overhead. The transactions are confirmed by the current leader RSU node, which reduces the confirmation time. **Security analysis** This subsection presents the security performance of the proposed system discussing various types of possible attacks, and how the proposed system can counter those attacks. There are no standardized performance metrics to quantitatively analyze the comparative security performance of vehicular networks using blockchain, as many complex factors are involved including dynamic topology, vehicular speeds, data rates, communication technology, and so on. Therefore, we present a qualitative analysis of security performance of the proposed system highlighting its feasibility in vehicular networks. The proposed system is based on blockchain as a backbone, and therefore inherits all the inherent security features provided by a blockchain network such as, confidentiality, integrity, authentication, nonrepudiation, and immutability. **Scientific Reports** |     (2023) 13:4412 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-31442-w 11 Vol.:(0123456789) www.nature.com/scientificreports/ The following are some of the possible security attacks on the proposed system, and how the system is capable to counter those attacks. **Integrity violation.** - _Attack method:_ An attacker tries to modify the contents of any block. - _Proposed solution:_ In the proposed model, the sequence and contents of the blocks are secured using a hash chain where each block has a unique hash value. If an attacker tries to modify the contents of any block, the attacker needs to modify the current block as well as recalculate the hash values of all subsequent blocks in the chain which is extreme resource consuming, thus making it difficult for an adversary to successfully carry out a message modification attack. **Sybil attack.** - _Attack method:_ The attacker generates numerous fake identities of a node to spread forged messages in the ­network [45] . Using such mechanism, an attacker tries to gain the control on the network to carryout illegal activities, such as refusing the transactions. - _Proposed solution:_ The proposed system is resistant to Sybil attacks as it requires a majority of nodes to agree on the validity of a new block before it can be added to the chain. To maintain a strong identify verification process in place, the proposed system maintains an access control list which contains the registered RSUs of the network. The blocks encrypted with the public-key pair and registered in the access control list will be verified by the other RSUs. **Eclipse attack.** - _Attack Method:_ An attacker isolates a node from the rest of the network and submits conflicting transactions, potentially causing the node to make decisions based on incorrect ­information [46] . - _Proposed solution:_ The proposed work ensured that the leaders have robust and diverse communication channels, as well as implemented measures such as peer-review and transaction validation by at least 50% of the RSU nodes. **Denial of Service (DoS) attack.** - _Attack method:_ The attacker floods the network with many invalid or malicious transactions, disrupting the normal functioning of the ­blockchain [47] . - _Proposed solution:_ The proposed system is not vulnerable to DoS attacks because it is not reliant on a single central server or point of failure. Instead, it relies on a network of nodes that all have copies of the blockchain, making it more difficult for an attacker to take down the system by targeting a single point. **Selfish mining attack.** - _Attack method:_ Miners try to disrupt the system by withholding newly mined blocks from the network and only releases those when it is to their ­advantage [48] . This can allow the attackers to earn a disproportionate share of the rewards for mining new blocks at the expense of other miners in the network. - _Proposed solution:_ Our model addresses this issue by requiring all the nodes to agree on the order in which updates are applied to the ledger. If a node mines a block, it needs to propagate the block within the heartbeat timeout, otherwise, it will be unable to reach consensus with the other nodes and the block will not be added to the ledger. **Transaction ordering dependence attack.** - _Attack method:_ A transaction ordering attack occurs when a malicious actor attempts to manipulate the order in which transactions are recorded on the ­blockchain [49] . If the attacker can convince enough of the network nodes to accept its version of the transaction, it may be able to disrupt the normal operation of the network. - _Proposed solution:_ The proposed model applies Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) strategy, where transactions are ordered based on their timestamps such that the transaction with the most recent timestamp is processed first. This can help to prevent the transaction ordering attacks, as it ensures that the order in which transactions are recorded on the blockchain reflects the order in which they were actually made. **Achievements, limitations, and future research directions** We proposed a blockchain based framework to ensure data security in vehicular network environments. The smart contracts are used to ensure decentralization by letting multiple stationary nodes to append a block in a ledger. The proposed technique demonstrates improvement in the results when compared with the stateof-the-art mechanisms in terms of throughput and the number of blocks created per node while ensuring decentralization. The selfish mining problem is addressed by setting the threshold to create a block in a specified **Scientific Reports** |     (2023) 13:4412 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-31442-w Vol:.(1234567890) 12 www.nature.com/scientificreports/ time. Moreover, the transaction latency is also reduced by proposing the separation of transaction confirmation and block creation process. Like the previous research works, the proposed system also suffers from a few limitations. Cryptography is globally considered as an acceptable security solution for many applications, and our proposed work utilizes cryptography as a first security layer. However, cryptographic based security is still vulnerable to various types of attacks. Especially, the availability of quantum computing devices at adversarial end may increase the security challenges for vehicular networks. Therefore, in future we aim to explore the trust and reputation mechanisms to identify the misbehaving node. Moreover, an incentive mechanism will be introduced to encourage honest nodes in block creation process. Future research will also focus on different vehicular network attacks and their quantitative analysis under different conditions with blockchain implementation. A factor that can affect the speed of block confirmation is the block size. If the block size is too large, it can take longer for the block to be propagated throughout the network, which can increase the time it takes to confirm the block. On the other hand, if the block size is too small, it may not be able to accommodate enough transactions, which can lead to delays in processing transactions. To address this issue, in future we aim to implement dynamic block sizing, which allows the block size to adapt to the current transaction rate and network conditions. This can help in reducing the block propagation delay and speed up the block confirmation process. Separating beacon messages from event messages can also help in improving the efficiency of the blockchain network. Beacon messages are used to synchronize the state of the network and to ensure that all nodes have the same view of the blockchain. Event messages, on the other hand, contain information about transactions and other events that have occurred on the network. By separating these two types of messages, it can be easier to process and disseminate event messages, which can help avoid delays in the network. Scalability is another limitation of the proposed system as the number of vehicles can be considerably large in a real-word scenario. We aim to use sharding in the future model which will help us improve the scalability performance, security, and resource requirements of a vehicular network by dividing the network into smaller, independent units called shards. Each shard can process transactions and maintain its own copy of the blockchain, allowing the overall network to handle larger volumes of transactions without sacrificing performance and making it more difficult for a single entity to gain control or launch an attack. Additionally, sharding can reduce the resource requirements for each RSU or vehicle by allowing them to process transactions and maintain their own copy of the blockchain without having to store and process the entire network’s data. **Conclusion** The paper presents a blockchain based data security solution for vehicular networks. The integration of blockchain technology in the vehicular networks has the potential to transform the transportation system and introducing many applications that can build on top of blockchain. There is a tradeoff between providing security and timely message dissemination in vehicular networks based on blockchain. If the consensus mechanism is based on utilizing huge resources of the miner such as time, computational power, storage, and coins, stronger will be the security of the blockchain network. However, increasing the security can result in a decrease in throughput. It is also noted that the increase in the number of transactions in the block can lead to a delay in block creation and propagation time. It has been observed that by increasing the number of generated transactions by vehicles, there is also an increase in the confirmed transactions. **Data availabilty** The authors did not use any external dataset for simulation. The simulations are performed using NS-3 that has built-in modules to generate synthetic mobility and connectivity patterns. Received: 17 October 2022; Accepted: 11 March 2023 **References** 1.

Keywords: Big data; ioT; security assessment; fuzzy AHP 1 Introduction The IoT is a current development in the present world in which all objectives are connected to the internet for increasing the quality of our daily lives without human interaction to share information [1,2]. The development of internet-enabled objectives has accelerated dramatically. As per the analysis report of This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited. 1072 IASC, 2022, vol.32, no.2 CISCO-2020, more than 50 billion objectives will be needed to be interconnected. IoT is a noble and sensible approach that makes physical things more accessible with minimum human effort. IoT has been used in a variety of applications, including smart healthcare, smart farming, and smart cities. The amount of data acquired by these IoT objectives in numerous formats including unstructured and structured is growing by the day. Maintaining the security of huge data is a critical issue. The 4Vs of big data (Velocity, Value, Volume, and Veracity) reduce the level of security that is necessary. Several research works have been acknowledged for comprehending and categorizing the approaches for assessing security in order to improve big data security services [3–5]. The authors are attempting to re-establish big data security by evaluating it using several security approaches [6–10]. Although there is a lot of study in this field, there isn’t much in the way of assessing the properties of big data security to world problems in the literature. The factors of large data security are crucial in ensuring security. With CIAAE (Confidentiality, Integrity, Authenticity, Availability and Efficiency), security factors may have an impact on big data security services. These factors each have a unique role to play in ensuring security [11–14]. Further, neglecting security properties is not an option for assessment. Even so, assessing big data security is a management issue because each firm has its own approach [15– 21]. The evaluation requires decision-makers to recognize preferences while maintaining large data security. Although, the Fuzzy-AHP approach is being used by the authors in this paper for the assessment [22–27]. It is critical to developing a hierarchy that identifies the properties that are impacted by big data security for this assessment. Big data security has been analyzed using the hierarchy and the Fuzzy-AHP. Finally, the findings and conclusions of this paper can be employed to improve big data security. The following is the outline for this paper: The second segment goes over previous big data security work. The third segment covers the fundamentals of IoT, big data, healthcare big data analytics, and big data security. The procedure was provided in the fourth section, and the findings were discussed. Section five contains the conclusion of the proposed task. 2 Literature Review Kambatla [4] presented a functional structure that recognizes the capture, processing, mining, and managing of IoT big data. Data storage module, a data processing module, data management module, data acquisition, and integration module, and application optimization module are some of the technical modules discussed. In addition, IoT applications, experiments, prospects, and certain open issues were highlighted, along with some important examples. Hashem [5] updated the existing situation and planned guidelines for using remote health monitoring in combination. Before systems can be designed for seamless integration into clinical practice, various obstacles in sensing, analytics, and visualization must be addressed, according to this study. Ali [6] presented research work on storage models, data privacy, data kinds, data security, and big data application analysis approaches. The recommended work also discussed the issues and expansion of big data in terms of forecasting current and future trends. Finally, in the era of big data, possible issues of big data security and machine learning approaches are addressed. Hashem [7] projected a novel framework to process and analyze the massive amount of big data in a cloud context based on Hadoop from the healthcare perspective. This research work defined the significance of big data that is used to take accurate results for health practitioners by choosing the right care. Several approaches based on cryptography were employed to secure the framework. Map Reduce approach was employed for healthcare-based big data to increase performance. Further, Hadoop was employed to analyze the massive healthcare-based big data more appropriately. IASC, 2022, vol.32, no.2 1073 Elijah [8] discussed a summary of big data analytics and IoT in the agricultural field. Precision agriculture, agriculture machinery, observing, tracing, tracking, and production were all briefly discussed as areas where IoT in agriculture is being developed. Demonstrated the significance of big data analytics and how it can assist with insurance, farm management, storage, decision-making, precision farming, and prediction from an agriculture perspective. Finally, the future issues and challenges that are open have been acknowledged and deliberated. Security and cost were identified as factors that this study found to be challenging in the farming industry. Nalini [9] presented big data analytics and IoT. The challenges of big data and IoT were deliberated such as data security issues, big data storage, big data analytics, impact on day-to-day living. The inefficiencies occur in data collection including money, time, efforts, and loss of status when security was being compromised. Siddiqa [10] revisited the advanced features of big data including background, history, and related technologies. Mainly, this work motivated big data analytic classes, architecture, stages, and explained big data issues or challenges specifically security, privacy, accurate decisions, heterogeneous sources, minimum energy consumption, and within time. More, the various applications of big data were described with some instances: government, healthcare, agriculture, telecommunication, transportation insurance, banking, manufacturing, retail, and customer products. 3 Big Data and Internet of Things Sensors, gadgets, temperature sensors, healthcare applications, digital devices, and software programs generate massive amounts of unstructured, or semi-structured, and organized data that are all producing more data. Further, big data is the outcome of this tremendous data creation [6]. When it comes to keeping, treating, and analyzing rapidly rising amounts of large data, traditional database systems are inefficient [7]. The term “big data” has been used in the past, but it is comparatively different from the perspective of Information Technology (IT) [9]. The next frontier for improvement, competition, and production is an example of big data-related theories; were, [13] defined big data as the number of datasets that are a better database system tool than the typical tools for obtaining, keeping, treating, and analyzing such data [8]. According to the IT world [11], extracting value from a massive volume of data in many formats by allowing high-speed data discovery, analysis and capture are the main objectives of big data technology. Also, big data is divided into three categories including data sources, data analytics, and analytics findings presentations. The 3Vs (Volume, Variety, and Velocity) paradigm produced by Steed [11] that is used to define big data. The 3Vs model illustrates an e-commerce trend during managing the data that encounter volume or size management difficulties. 3.1 Types of Big Data The big data are categorized into three ways which are given below: 3.1.1 Structured Big Data Structured data is defined as data that can be monitored, accessed, and managed in a stable way [12]. It denotes to extremely structured material that can be stored and accessed from a database with ease using simple search engine approaches. For example, the personnel table in a firm database will be designed so that employee information, such as job titles, salaries, and so on, is organized. 3.1.2 Unstructured Big Data Unstructured data refers to information that does not have a clear shape or organization [13]. Processing and analyzing unstructured data becomes extremely difficult and time-consuming according to the results. A 1074 IASC, 2022, vol.32, no.2 heterogeneous data source including a variety of simple text files, photos, videos, and email, for example, is one example of unstructured data. 3.1.3 Semi-Structured Big Data Structured and unstructured large data can both be found in semi-structured data [14]. We can acquire semi-structured data in a structured format, but it is not defined by a table definition in a relational database management system. A data set contained in an Extensible Markup Language (XML) file is an example of semi-structured data. 3.2 Internet of Things IoT provides a stage for sensors, things, and equipment that allows for unfettered communication in a smart environment and facilitates data sharing between sites [15]. The most recent version of wireless-based numerous technologies employs IoT as the next breakthrough tool, and internet technology will provide the opportunity. With evolving smart systems include smart offices, smart agriculture, smart retail, smart transportation, smart healthcare, smart water supply, and smart energy, IoT has gained different acceptance during constructing smart cities [16,17]. In recent years, the IoT has developed as a different style that may be utilized to collect data in mobile devices, transportation services, home applications, and general utilities [17–19]. Emergency alarms, wristwatches, garage doors, and vending machines as well as home appliances such as refrigerators, air conditioners, water heaters, and microwave ovens, are all connected to an IoT network and managed remotely [18–20]. Huge numbers of communication devices are incorporated in sensors in the IoT paradigm. Data is captured via sensors, and it will be sent via embedded communication devices. Several communication options, such as ZigBee, Bluetooth, Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM), and Wireless Fidelity (WiFi), are used to keep devices and objects connected [21]. The communication devices receive commands and exchange data from remote-controlled equipment, allowing for direct incorporation with the outside world via computers to enhance the quality of life. More than fifty billion gadgets, including smart sensors, laptops, phones, and game consoles are expected to be connected to the internet using emerging technologies [22–24]. IoT’s most recent version of numerous wireless technologies is the next innovative technology that helps utilize all possibilities. 4 Big Data Analytics Big data analytics is the procedure of mining, finding, and analyzing large databases in order to restore decision-making performance [1,3–5]. The capability to analyze large amounts of data can support a corporation deal with significant data that can have a negative impact on the company. As an outcome, the primary purpose of big data analytics is to assist corporations in better comprehending data and making well-informed decisions. Data miners and scientists can use big data analytics to investigate enormous amounts of data that aren’t accessible with outdated tools [2,4]. Big data analytics necessitates a variety of technologies and approaches that may be used to convert massive amounts of semi-structured, unstructured, and structured data into a format that can be analyzed. Algorithms are frequently used in these analytical tools to find diverse trends, patterns, and interactions in data at different time intervals. The systematic tools depict the outcomes in the form of graphs, spatial charts, and tables for operational decision-making when the data analysis is completed. As the outcomes of the scalability and complexity of data, as well as the underlying algorithms that allow such approaches, big data analysis is a significant issue in many applications. As a result, the focus of the issue is on the performance of current algorithms employed in big data analysis as the number of computational inputs continues to expand rapidly. While some technologies can IASC, 2022, vol.32, no.2 1075 handle enormous data collections in a reasonable amount of time, big data analytics approaches take a long time to provide users with feedback and assistance. Contrary to popular belief, the majority of the remaining tools rely on complicated approaches such as trial-and-error to deal with these massive datasets and data heterogeneity. 4.1 Categories of Healthcare Big Data Analytics Different forms of analytics are available based on the needs of IoT applications [5–7]. The real-time, memory-level, off-line, large level, and Business Intelligence (BI) level analytics categories are described in this subsection. Fig. 1 also includes a comparison based on the types of analytics and their levels. Figure 1: Healthcare big data analytic types - Using business intelligence and data mining, descriptive analytics helps to demonstrate a picture of the past. Experience, as we all know, teaches us a lot. Using this data aids in the delivery of an approach for drawing a plan to achieve the goal. - When compared to traditional business approaches, predictive analytics using large datasets helps to improve the client experience while also increasing the results. It enables the evaluation of large volumes of transactional and unstructured data at the same time, with the results assisting in the prediction of the future. Predicting the future based on usable datasets has been a difficult task since the dawn of computing till now. This form of business intelligence application aids in the computation of data streams with a broader reach, such as shopping experiences, social media content, survey results, and everyday user actions. - The term “prescriptive analytics” refers to a tool that makes recommendations. By learning patterns, prior approaches, and data inputs, the system delivers suggestions based on the outcomes it has generated (unstructured and structured). This approach also permits for analyzing and recommending based on the conclusions of any other study on a similar action. By entering data from other research, it aids in connecting the dots and delivering answers based on both ascribed efforts. Since we cannot completely rely on machines, which are human inventions, they are only seen as possibilities. Though, depending on the findings, a thorough investigation into alternative solutions to a problem can be conducted. 1076 IASC, 2022, vol.32, no.2 4.2 Big Data Analytics Life Cycle For data science projects and big data problems, the data analytic lifecycle is taken into account. To handle the many requirements for executing big data analysis, a step-by-step procedure is required to arrange the activities and tasks associated with data acquisition, processing, analysis, and repurposing (Tab. 1). Table 1: Lifecycle of data analytics Data Analytics Descriptions Lifecycle Discovery - Data science investigates and learns about the problem. Improve context and comprehension. - Learn about the data sources that will be required and accessible for the assignment. - The team develops early hypotheses that can be verified with data later. Model Planning - Data science creates datasets for producing, training, and testing at this level. - Based on the work done during the model planning phase, the team builds and executes models. - Explores data to discover links between variables, then chooses crucial variables and the best appropriate models. - MATLAB and STATISTICA are two popular tools for this step. Data Preparations - Before modeling and analysis, there are steps to discover, pre-process, and condition data. - It necessitates the creation of an analytic sandbox, as well as the execution, loading, and transformation of data into the sandbox by the team. - Tasks for data preparation are anticipated to be completed several times and in no particular order. - Hadoop, Alpine Miner, Open Refine, and other tools are normally used for this phase. Communication - Next the execution of the model, the team must relate the results to the success and Results failure criteria defined. - The team evaluates how to communicate funding to numerous team members and stakeholders in the most effective way possible, taking into consideration suggestions and assumptions. - The team should categorize major financing sources, calculate the business value, and create a narrative to summarise and communicate funding sources to participants. Model Building - Create datasets for use in testing and production. - Teams also examine whether their current tools are adequate for running models or if they require a more robust environment for model execution. - Rand PL/R, Octave, and WEKA are examples of free and open-source software. - MATLAB and STATISTICA are commercial tools. Operationalize - The team communicates the project's benefits more clearly and establishes an experimental project to organize work in a controlled manner before expanding the project's complete enterprise of consumers. - This tactic allows the team to learn about the model's performance and restrictions in a production setting on a modest scale before deploying it fully. - Final reports, briefings, and codes are delivered by the team. - Octave, SQL, and MADLIB are examples of free and open-source software. IASC, 2022, vol.32, no.2 1077 4.3 Connection Between Big Data Analytics and IoT In the IoT, big data analytics is rapidly evolving for active decision-making. The study of “connected items” is one of the most essential components of IoT. Further, IoT and big data analytics necessitate the processing of a large amount of data and its storage in a variety of storage systems. Because the majority of unstructured data is collected in an open manner from web-enabled devices, big data solutions must combine light intelligence analysis with larger queries in order to obtain fast insights, make fast decisions, and communicate with humans and machines. The integrated architecture and built operating system enable sophisticated applications by allowing groups of sensing and activating devices to share information on sites. In general, IoT expands the quantity and variety of data. In addition, it opens the door to big data analytics applications and development. The goal of big data technologies in IoT is to speed up the development of IoT and commercial models. Fig. 2 depicts the association between IoT and big data. To handle IoT data, three processes are involved. The first step is to manage IoT databases, which are used by networked sensors to communicate with one another. Figure 2: IoT and big data analytics relationship For example, communication equipment like smart traffic lights, smart home devices, and ClosedCircuit Television (CCTV) cameras generate massive amounts of data in a variety of forms. The data will be kept in a low-cost cloud storage system. Data is created in the second phase, which is referred to as “big data” because of its volume, velocity, and variety. Shared distributed error handler databases will be used to store this vast amount of data. In the final phase, analytics technologies such as Map-Reduce are used to analyze big IoT datasets. The four levels of analysis start with experimental data and go to analytic queries, tools, and reports at the next level. 1078 IASC, 2022, vol.32, no.2 4.4 Big Data Analytics in Healthcare By identifying connections from a large volume of healthcare data, big data analytics has the prospective to enhance the quality of care and lower patient medical costs by providing a broader viewpoint of clinical competence based on medical evidence and numerous tests. Advanced analytical approaches and tools used in healthcare systems deliver services that meet an increasing need by allowing healthcare organizations to handle large amounts of data in real-time, analyze in real-time, and remove data from all patients’ medical records. The primary goal of Big Data Analytics (BDA) is to enhance the functioning of a healthcare facility so that people can live healthier lives. This includes numerous analytical tools for understanding factors linkages and discovering knowledge, including machine learning, pattern identification, visualization, and data mining. Big data analytics is founded on the notion of data mining, which entails using a variety of analytical approaches to evaluate and examine massive amounts of data in order to extract relevant and usable information. The publications [8–11] may provide example proof concerning big data analytics and healthcare to the authors of this work. The goal of big data analytics in smart healthcare the volume of data in the healthcare business is always growing from numerous sources, but processing this data in hard or soft copy formats is quite difficult [12]. Data digitalization can help solve this problem, but one of the most difficult tasks is analyzing all of the data. When dealing with vast amounts of data, data analysis is critical because it will be utilized to make judgments. Big data analysis creates a new method for healthcare systems that requires estimating the reasonable time for producing reasonable discretions, organizing future perspectives, and maximizing time value. At the same time, it assists health institutions in providing cognitive knowledge on their planning, management, and measurements. Finally, the estimated results are a tool to help managers improve their executive abilities. The usage of IoT data analytics in the healthcare business is depicted in Fig. 3. Figure 3: IoT data analytics concerning healthcare 5 Big Data Security: A Point of Concern Big data is primarily classified into four elements based on the data: volume, variety, velocity, and value, which is referred to as the 4 V‘s model represented by Kumar et al. [13] (Fig. 4). This approach is primarily highlighted by an e-commerce trend in which data management issues include managing enormous amounts of data, a variety of data, and the speed with which data is generated. IASC, 2022, vol.32, no.2 1079 Volum e Velocity Figure 4: Big data’s 4 V’s in healthcare 5.1 Volume Some factors contribute to the data volume and it could be transactional data that has been collected over time or data flowing through social media [14,15]. The data volume refers to the total amount of mass data in an organization. The volume of data created in an organization grows at a random rate, which can be measured in petabytes and zeta bytes depending on the organization’s making actions and kind. 5.2 Velocity The data in the full data transferred currently in an organization or motion is referred to as velocity [16]. The rate at which an organization generates, processes, and analyses data are usually increasing. It has an impact on how data is formed and sent from one place to the next. It’s frequently time-sensitive. 5.3 Value We must concentrate on value as a major issue. The amount of data we save or process isn’t the only factor that determines value [17]. It is the amount of valuable, dependable, and trustworthy data that must be saved, processed, and analyzed in order to uncover insights. 5.4 Veracity Veracity, which is made up of data about which the organization is unsure [18,19]. It examines the degree to which various types of data are regarded as reliable. Factors such as weather and consumer feedback, as well as reaching a choice, typically delay an organization’s executing of processes to guarantee the quality and reliability of data. Security has several significant factors of big data security that have an indirect impact. CIAAE is a set of factors. Auxiliary, CIAAE is one of the security pillars [3,5,11–14]. Confidentiality denotes to the permission of authorized access to sensitive and secure data in the context of security. Integrity is a demand-driven factor that is recognized by ethical assurance and resolutions. In the context of a computer system, availability denotes to a customer’s ability to access information or assets for a specific amount of time. This work contributes to a fuzzy AHP-based assessment of big data security. Fig. 5 depicts a tree structure of big data security features [15–17]. Further, Fig. 5 shows that CIAAE and EDS (Efficiency, Durability, and Storage Capacity) affect the security of big data [13–17]. Big data security may be enhanced by targeting CIAAE with EDS together [15,17,19]. Hence, these factors should be involved in the assessment of big data security. We must protect data from leakage since confidentiality is the foundation of big data security and privacy. The value of the data will be lost if it is leaked [16]. If hackers target the data and change it or unearth secret 1080 IASC, 2022, vol.32, no.2 information, the value of the big data could be lost. Because big data security and privacy demand a lot of network bandwidth, efficiency is very important [17,18]. Authenticity is required to ensure that data sources, processors, and authorized data requesters are trustworthy [19,20]. Authenticity can help you avoid bad analysis results and get the most out of your big data. Figure 5: A tree structure of big data security factors Big data should be available whenever we require it. Otherwise, its worth may dwindle. Integrity is also necessary for obtaining useful and reliable data. We cannot analyze the correct conclusion with wrong or partial data, especially when the missing data is the most sensitive and useful. The longevity of big data security for a given time period is characterized as durability [23]. Security durability has a considerable impact on big data security because the time limit of security has a substantial impact on total big data security. Storage capacity is a sub-aspect of big data security that works with various storage systems to determine how much data must be available in storage nodes at the same time. 6 Fuzzy Based Decision Making Approach The major goals are to establish goals based on the weight and categorization of the security attribute of big data through a multi-criteria decision-making process that demonstrates the usage of analytical hierarchy, in order to create a secure and dependable network [3]. Because no efforts to objectively categorize and grade the big data security factors have been made, the Fuzzy AHP can be utilized to prioritize them [3,22]. Because it is useful in decision-making procedures to mitigate the problem of uncertainty and uncertainty, Fuzzy AHP produces more accurate findings than classical AHP [22]. This will improve the security and early detection of vulnerabilities, which will help consumers and organizations by increasing secure network capacity and durability. The AHP was used to explore the prioritization of large data security factors using a multi-criteria decision-making system [22,23]. Multiple-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) is an operation research sub-discipline that aids in the decision-making process by allowing for multiple assessments of conflicting criteria [24]. Further, when compared to other MCDM approaches, AHP is a superior approach for measuring the objective and subjective values of the qualities [24,25]. Regardless, the underlying vagueness and ambiguity found by drawing the consciousness of precise no’s of a decision-maker are impossible to measure with AHP [25]. The author discovered that practitioners consolidated fuzzy theory with AHP since the real world is especially shaky for investigating uncertain real situations [25,26]. Furthermore, the AHP uses the matrix for pair-wise comparisons in “MCDM” situations, as shown in Eq. (1). IASC, 2022, vol.32, no.2 1081 C1 C2 . . . Cn 1 a12 . . . a1n 1=a12 1 . . . a2n . .. [.] ..

A n-by-n matrix, A can be articulated as per appeared in Eq. (1). Let C1, C2… Cn indicates the arrangement of the feature while aij stand for an evaluated decision on a couple of features Ci, Cj. The relative consequences of the two factors are appraised utilizing a scale [22,23]. The Fuzzy AHP approach entails four important steps, which are detailed below. The issue is then organized into a hierarchical graded framework for Fuzzy AHP to address. The study’s purpose is to develop a hybrid model of MCDM large data security approaches. The huge data security factor structure is depicted in the diagram. This hierarchy can be created by employing expert opinions and replies in questionnaires, as well as brainstorming and other approaches. The Triangular Fuzzy Numbers (TFN) are then used to define the hierarchy. To begin, the problem is divided into hierarchical scaled arrangements in order to be tackled with Fuzzy AHP. It should be represented very clearly, and a systematic balanced structure, as shown in Fig. 5, is created (Tree diagram of big data security factors). The goal of this research is to gather information for a hybrid model of MCDM approaches for large data security. The structure of large data security factors is depicted in the diagram. This hierarchy is created by employing expert opinions and responses in a questionnaire/opinion poll, or by brainstorming and other approaches. There are a lot of unknown details in fuzzy set theory. A fuzzy collection is made up of membership range artifacts. A membership function defines such a factor, assigning a membership grade to each item that falls between zero and one (1). A fuzzy triangular form is depicted in Fig. 6. Figure 6: Comparison of the results TFN shown mainly as (Lo, Mi, Up). The Eqs. (2–4) are used to convert the numeric values into “TFN” [24,25] and signified as “(Loij, Miij, Upij) where Loij is lower value, Miij is middle value and Upij are the highest level events”. Further, TFN [ηij] is setup as the accompanying: gij ¼ ½Loij; Miij; Upij� Here Loij � Miij � Upij (2) 1082 IASC, 2022, vol.32, no.2 Loij ¼ minðJijkÞ (3) Miij ¼ ðJij1; Jij2 . . . . . . :JijkÞ [1][=][k] (4) Upij ¼ maxðJijkÞ (5) 0.18 0.16 0.14 0.12 0.1 0.08 0.06 0.04 0.02 0 C11 C12 C13 C21 C22 C23 C24 C31 C32 C33 C41 C42 C43 Fuzzy AHP Fuzzy ANP Classical AHP Classical ANP Figure 7: Triangular fuzzy numbers Jijk displays the relative value of two parameters provided by the expert z in the example above. Where i and j are calculated parameters by experts. The geometric mean for a set of relationships determines this value. Stakeholder consensus, which reflects the lowest and greatest ratings for the relative value of the two parameters, will be accurately summarized and described. After collecting the TFN value for each pair of reference points, a fuzzy matrix of (n x n) dimensions is created. This research combines analysts and engineers with big data security experience. AHP analysis is completely reliant on volunteers who have been carefully chosen. After qualitative evaluation, the “TFN” membership task and pair-wise comparisons are determined to construct the confusing choice matrix in the third step. Additional, when the matrix has been detected, defuzzification is performed to produce a quantifiable value based on assessed TFN values. Reverse fuzzification is defuzzification. The defuzzification approach used in this work was adapted from [26,27], which was created in Eqs. (5–7), and is known as alpha cutting. qabðA [~] Þ ¼ ½b:A [~] aðLoijÞ þ ð1 � bÞ:A [~] aðUpijÞ� (6) where 0 ≤α ≤ 1 and 0 ≤β≤ 1 Such that, A~ aðLoijÞ ¼ ðMiij � LoijÞ:a þ Loij (7) A~ aðUpijÞ ¼ Upij �ðUpij � MiijÞ:a (8) For professional states, these computations employ and. These two numbers range from 0 to 1. The alpha cut of a fuzzy set is an all-element package. An integer between 0 and 1 is used as the alphathreshold. It has an alpha threshold value that is more than or equal to the membership value set. The lesser and higher defused values are indicated by (Lo ij) and (Up ij). Eq. (8) depicts the matrix that was created after the participants’ decisions were evaluated. IASC, 2022, vol.32, no.2 1083 C1 C2 . . . . . . . . . . . . Cn 1 A0�; 2 ð~a 11Þ . . . . . .

[.] Cn (9) For a fuzzy number, aij indicates the relative relevance of two C1 factors. The ability to view a hazy package as a series of flat sets is sometimes aided by alpha reduction. Crisp sets, (a), effectively represent whether or not an entity belongs to a group. In Eq. (9), a single pair matrix is used. According to the outcomes, evaluating the peer-to-peer reference matrix is an additional step in this approach. Own vector computing is used to select the aggregated weight of specified norms. Expect that aij’s own vector is denoted by, and that the unusual factor of aij is denoted. ½qa; bðA [~] Þ � kI�:q ¼ 0 (10) Eq. (10) is based on a linear vector transformation, which I discuss in more detail below. Weights with specified standards could be constructed for every other potential criteria by adding Eqs. (1–9) to the equation. Now, calculate the Ratio of Consistency (CR). If the CR value is less than 0.1, the AHP measurement is calculated accurately a second time. 7 Data Analysis and Results Big data security qualities are multi-dimensional and, in most cases, qualitative. Assessing the big data security aspects statistically becomes a difficult task. As a result, the relative weights and rankings of big data security criteria validate a major responsibility for network design that is highly secure. Tab. 2 shows a built aggregated fuzzy pair-wise comparison matrix that displays the priorities derived from many pair-wise comparisons at level 1. The fuzzified aggregated pair-wise comparison matrix at level 2 for sub-factors (C1, C2, C3, C4) is created by utilizing the geometric typical approach to analyze expert opinions (Eqs. (1–4)). Also, Tabs. 3–6 show the produced matrix fuzzy aggregated pair-wise comparison matrix at level 1.

While employing Fuzzy-AHP rather than conventional AHP, it is possible to obtain results that are more efficient and enhanced. It’s because utilizing Fuzzy with AHP produces more exact inputs and, crisper results. IASC, 2022, vol.32, no.2 1087 In big data security, Fig. 7 shows a graphical representation of the comparison of the outcomes derived from the Fuzzy-AHP and Classical AHP approaches, including global weights and the final ranking of the factors. Fuzzy-AHP is clearly superior to Classical AHP in terms of efficiency [25–27]. Big data security and IoT have gotten a lot of attention recently. In this day, big data security is a burgeoning field of study. The goal of the proposed research is to improve security aspects and compare fuzzy based approaches. 8 Conclusions In this day, big data security is a burgeoning field of study. Contributing factors in the area of big data security play an important role in determining security. Next, choosing the most important factor from a list of options is vital for effective big data security. Based on large data security, this paper expressed viewpoints on the straight associated qualities and sub-factors. The assessment found that the directed dependency on Fuzzy Analytical Network Process (ANP), the ecological instance of validation, and trustworthiness are the most planned factors of all. The comprehensive values have been calculated as the results of the effective application of Fuzzy AHP. The priority-based attribute listing aids in determining the utmost significant factors among a large number of factors in big data security. Furthermore, periodization will aid in devising approaches for determining the most effective use of big data security in explicit analysis and mitigation mechanisms. We are excited to conduct numerous experiments employing various MCDM approaches on the same research problem and in various IoT applications including smart healthcare. The suggested effort is a quantitative assessment that aims to improve the strength of big data security features. The following are the primary implications of the proposed work: - The security approaches will be improved, evaluated, identified, and prioritised by focusing on big data security factors. - MCDM approaches, such as Fuzzy-AHP, have been shown to produce more efficient findings than Classical AHP, making them a viable approach for assessing large data security.

Most of our systems can be hacked, and it causes very high risks to our confidential files inside the systems. Therefore, for various security reasons, we use various methods to save as much as possible on this data, regardless of its different forms, texts, pictures, videos, etc. In this paper, we mainly rely on storing the basic image which should be protected in another image after changing its formal to composites using the DWT wavelet transform. The process of zeroing sites and storing their contents technique is used to carry the components of the main image. Then process them mathematically by using the exponential function. The result of this process is to obtain a fully encrypted image. The image required to be protected from detection and discrimination is hidden behind the encrypted image. The proposed system contains two algorithms. The first algorithm is used for encoding and hiding, but the second algorithm is designed for returning and decoding the main image to its original state with very efficiently. **Keywords** —encryption, discrete wavelet transform, steganography, modulated image, hidden image **1** **Introduction** Images encryption strategies are broadly utilized to overcome the issue of safe transferring for both images and messages via electronic transfer media both images and messages via electronic transfer media by utilizing the classical cryptographic processes [1–3]. However, the main problem of this method is that it is limited use remains with the huge amounts of data or high-resolution images [4, 5]. The process of hiding the board image was completed after removing the most important part of the data in the embedded image. This data was saved because it is considered as a decryption key. The fundamental indication of this research paper is to stow away and encrypt the full image interior another one [6]. At first: images should have analyzed using wavelet transform formula, where the images go through levels of (DWT). This process produced four factors conditions, (ca), (ch), (cv), and (cd). Then comes the process of clearing enough space to include target image components on embedded image components. To make the appropriate images more secretly, exponential function 144 http://www.i-jim.org _Paper_ —Enhanced Data Security of Communication System Using Combined Encryption and… math was used. Decryption was mainly based on returning the last discarding values to their original positions of images, then it takes the Inverse Discrete Wavelet Transform (IDWT) to produce un-secure data. The most objective of this strategy is to hide images with 2-D and 3-D on other images to produce a single encrypted image with tall effectiveness. **2** **Literature review** Some authors show that a biometric verification system which usages two individual biometric structures collective by waterline inserting with secret PIN encryption to get a non-unique ID of each person [7–9]. The converted structures and models trek over unconfident the Internet or intranet of the communication system in the client-server situation. In addition, the researchers suggested a method that composite of encryption and information hiding the use of a few characteristics of Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) sequences [10–12]. The suggested system contains two parts. The first part has the confidential information encoded by using a DNA and Amino Acids-Based Show reasonable cryptograph. the second part contains the encoded information steganography assistant which secreted into some location of DNA classification. Also, the authors suggested an LSB & DCT-based steganography process for saving the information [13–17]. All the information bits are implanted by modifying the slightest noteworthy bit low frequency bits of Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) factors which include the image segments [11, 18, 19]. In [20–22], they suggest improved protection for the data. By using encryption and steganography. The information is encrypted and hidden behind an image then transferred to the cloud afterward. The image can be downloaded whenever it seems appropriate and the data can be decoded to recover the original file. In [23], They used the RSA encryption algorithm and image steganography for data concealment, as well as the LSB approach. The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm was adjusted and used to encode the secret message. The encrypted message was protected using this technique. In [24–27], A technique used on the advanced LSB (least significant bit) and RSA algorithm was discussed. It is less chance of an attacker being enabled to use steganalysis to recover data when matching data to an image. In [28], They suggest a new form of steganography based on gray m level modulation using image transformation, hidden key, and cryptography for true color images. Both the private key and the secret data are initially encoded using multiple encryption algorithms (bitxor processing, bit shuffling, and stego key based encoding); then encoded in the pixels of the host image. In addition, before data hiding, the input image was transposed. Objective analysis employing several image quality evaluation criteria is used to evaluate the proposed technique, which shows promising results in terms of secret data and preservation. In [29], They suggest a new combination method of cryptanalysis and steg analysis by using an HTML file. RJDA is a method that uses LSB (least significant bit) as an algorithm for steganography and encryption/decryption. Confidentiality is one of most critical security criteria to ensure that the purpose of saving or transmitting data cannot be interpreted by any other unauthenticated person. In [30], They implement techniques that combine cryptography and steganography to encode the data as well as to conceal the iJIM ‒ Vol. 15, No. 16, 2021 145 _Paper_ —Enhanced Data Security of Communication System Using Combined Encryption and… image details. It provides the data being transmitted with two layers of protection and also focuses on the power of mixing methods of cryptography and steganography. In [31], They use LSB (Least Significant Bit) as a steganography method and AES, RSA, DES, 3DES, and Blowfish as cryptographic algorithms to encrypt the information that should be concealed in an image. The work in this paper demonstrates an increase in the capacity of the current steganography techniques to accommodate. In this paper, a new method which combine both of techniques is proposed to obtain better results. a method involving both these techniques to gain better results has developed. Firstly, the encrypted image should be encoded using the Rivest–Shamir–Adleman (RSA) symmetric encryption cryptography and transformed to American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) values. the received encrypted message in decimal format is changed to octal and finally to binary format. Secondly, the binary bits obtained are disguised inside any digital image using Least Significant Bits insertion to make a new image with a special key known as stego image, which is delivered to the recipient who executes inverse operations to acquire the encrypted image. Between the source and stego images, the Mean Squared Error and Peak Signal to Noise Ratio values are calculated, and the model accuracy by this technique are shown to be much better than most of the other methods. **3** **The proposed system** The proposed system is divided into main three parts.

This paper deals with security difficulties and how can be stopped. The cryptography and Steganography the method is used to secure data. Table I shows that that the closing of the main characteristics of the images involved in the encryption process resulted from the encrypted image with less entropy, and it is noted that the correlation values closed to zero, indicating the quality of the method, i.e., closer result to zero better quality of the method. After eliminating the protection and decrypting, the resulting images show that it is exactly the same as the main image. The approach used in this paper will assist to create a confident construction for data security. **7** **References** [1] M. Kaur and V.

      "_Introduction_": "**Background** Mobile health (mHealth) is defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) as mobile apps and wearable devices used for health care. Software programs that provide health-related services used by mobile phones and tablets are called mHealth apps [1]. Mobile apps were first introduced by Apple and then by Google Play in 2010. Since then, apps have been frequently used by mobile device users [2]. According to Statista, which reports on data related to the number of apps available on the leading app stores, 3.48 million apps were available on Google Play in the first quarter of 2021, and 2.22 million were available https://mhealth.jmir.org/2022/5/e33735 JMIR Mhealth Uhealth 2022 | vol. 10 | iss. 5 | e33735 | p. 1 _(page number not for citation purposes)_",
      "XSL [•] FO": "**[RenderX](http://www.renderx.com/)** JMIR MHEALTH AND UHEALTH Alfawzan et al on the Apple App Store. Among the most popular apps are those in the category of health and fitness [3]. The growing number of mobile apps, including mHealth apps, has produced a demand for health services and increased access to health information by mobile app users [1]. Women’s health is a field that focuses on the effect of gender on disease and health and encompasses a range of biological and psychosocial issues [4]. Women’s health is broad and consists of several dimensions: sexual and reproductive health (including pregnancy, sexually transmitted diseases, and menopause), physical health and life expectancy (including nutrition, exercise, and weight management), and mental health. The aforementioned dimensions of women’s health are those that are commonly characterized on the mHealth market [5]. In our study, we explored what is available on the market under the topic of women’s health. Hundreds of thousands of apps provide services for women on the Apple App Store and Google Play. These apps monitor women’s health and bodily functions, including ovulation, pregnancy, breastfeeding, menstrual cycles, physical activities, mental health, mood levels, stress, and sleep [2]. Millions of people worldwide use women’s health apps [6]. The topics covered by women’s health apps include fitness, lifestyle management, nutrition, diet, reproductive health, medication adherence, and disease management. However, fewer apps are directly related to women’s sexual health and fertility than to diet and exercise [7]. A WHO report recognized that reproductive, maternal, newborn, and children’s health have been a priority for mHealth services in alignment with WHO initiatives, such as the Millennium Development Goals and Every Woman Every Child [1]. In the same report, the WHO recommended the use of women’s mHealth apps in rural areas and low-income countries. Notably, low-cost women’s mHealth apps tend to increase their popularity, especially among rural and low-income countries [8]. In the market, _femtech_ ( _female technology_ ; ie, technology geared to female audiences) is an industrial term. Femtech refers to technology related to women’s health, such as software, services, diagnostics, or products [9]. The term _femtech_ was coined by the cofounder of Clue, one of the most famous fertility-tracking companies. In her blog, Tin [10] stated that “what female health needs through technology is femtech.” Because half of the global population is female, investment in femtech is growing according to demand [9]. Femtech firms have received significant investment funding. In 2012 alone, they attracted US $57 million; this number increased to US $392 million in 2018 and reached US $2.3 billion in 2020 [11]. This has led to the design of a business model that focuses on individual empowerment involving self-designated women’s health technologies. Women-centered technology is a new concept that has been gaining popularity in the market and has been related to the increased observability of women’s health issues [12]. This huge growth and expansion in the femtech market comes with the price that some of these apps use the data they collect to generate profit. This occurred, for example, in the case of Bounty UK, a pregnancy and parenthood website and app; the UK Information and Commissioner’s Office found that the company supplied and sold data related to pregnant women, new mothers, and infants to a third party “without being fully clear with people that it might do so” [13]. In the sociocultural context, women’s bodies have always been characterized as fluctuating and requiring a high amount of self-regulation. Technology has become a tool for women to oversee their bodies and health [2]. In addition, women are considered to carry the most responsibility in the reproductive health process, from preventing pregnancy to monitoring it until delivery [14]. Motherhood, as in the sociocultural structure, can still affect women in terms of shaming and blaming, including domestic violence, which is strongly associated with unwanted pregnancy and abortion [6]. Furthermore, a lack of knowledge about fertility and the cultural reservation around it encourages women to use mHealth apps to obtain more clarity and awareness in this domain without needing to ask publicly [15]. Sociocultural norms make women more vulnerable in the new tech era [12]. Issues related to women’s bodies that are taboo in some cultures influence the demand for and use of women’s mHealth apps. In most reserved, family-oriented societies, women are expected to conceive a child. Women use these apps as an alternative method to protect themselves from cultural shame [16]. However, stigma about abortion and pregnancy leads some ideological campaigns to use these data to prevent women from obtaining help [6]. Women are under surveillance in some political structures; some states keep track of women’s periods to become aware of any acts of abortion that could be indicated from this information [17]. For example, the Missouri government kept records of women’s periods in clinics to flag any abortion attempts [18]. Moreover, the _ideal_ body image of women—an image that is thin but robust, sporty, and sexualized—has been commercialized, influencing the femtech industry to design apps for women that encourage women to strive toward this body image. This has provoked the need and increased the demand for such apps [2]. Women dealing with all these issues are placed in a vulnerable position because they are considered responsible for infertility, are pressured to conceive a child at a certain age or prevent pregnancy, and feel the need to maintain a certain body image [6]. In summary, the need and responsibility of women to conceive a child, prevent pregnancy, or obtain an abortion generates a high demand for women to use these apps. Cultural shame of women’s infertility or weight management leads them to use these apps as a safe zone. Therefore, the following question is raised: Are these apps valid and secure, and are they a safe zone for women? This question was addressed through our study. In general, personal and health-related data that could be collected in mHealth apps raise ethical concerns, particularly in terms of data privacy, sharing, and security. However, the type of data collected in femtech is typically sensitive, intimate data [17]. Furthermore, women’s mHealth apps are accessible and used on a global level. The practices are set in different cultures and backgrounds [12]. Modern technology has been affected by commercialism and masculinist ideologies [16]. Women’s mHealth apps are mainly commercial, and the data they collect are circulated among different agencies, generating profit for these apps [6]. User consent, especially about sharing data in general or with a third party, is a concern for women’s privacy. Women, as end users of these apps, typically share https://mhealth.jmir.org/2022/5/e33735 JMIR Mhealth Uhealth 2022 | vol. 10 | iss. 5 | e33735 | p. 2 _(page number not for citation purposes)_ **[RenderX](http://www.renderx.com/)** JMIR MHEALTH AND UHEALTH Alfawzan et al their personal, health, and intimate data. Research indicates that end users do not have full awareness of what their consent entails [17]. In femtech, the concerns about data privacy and sharing with the commercial agendas of these apps, who accesses the data, and how it is used are complicated and unclear. In addition, in the sociocultural context, women’s vulnerability related to privacy risk by mismanagement and misuse of these data is highly alarming [6]. In this study, we assessed the current practices of the most popular apps in terms of privacy and data sharing. The concept of women’s health and the case of mHealth is our focus in this report. The spectrum of women’s health encompasses more than just reproductive health and pregnancy. However, most previous studies have focused on reproductive health, pregnancy, and ovulation rather than on women’s health in general. As a result of the increasing number of women using health apps, as well as the increased number of women’s health apps available, we directed our focus to women’s health for this study. As women’s health has become digitalized in the form of femtech mHealth apps, the primary concern has been privacy and data protection [13]. **Privacy, Data Sharing, and Data Security Policies** In total, 3 main concerns arise when considering the ethical implications of mHealth apps: data privacy, data security, and data sharing. _**Data Privacy**_ Data privacy is the right of users to control how their information is collected, managed, and used. Data privacy is widely recognized as an essential freedom [19], and respect of data privacy is increasingly regulated at national and international levels, such as by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act in the United States [20]. Kotz [21] pointed out 25 subcategories of threats to data privacy in mHealth apps, which fall into three main categories: misuse of users’ identities, unauthorized access to data, and unauthorized disclosure of data. A recent scoping review by Nurgalieva et al [22] delineated further criteria for assessing privacy and privacy-related measures, including data ownership, confidentiality, permission systems, auditability, consent, notice of use, disclosure, authenticity, anonymization, data retention, and data access mechanisms. _**Data Sharing and Data Security**_ The concepts of privacy and data security partially overlap. Data security is a means to ensure the privacy of users’ data; however, as pointed out by Nurgalieva et al [22], “while security relates to protection against unauthorized access to data, privacy is an individual’s right to maintain control over and be free from intrusion into their private data and communications, and relates to trust in mHealth services.” Data security can thus be defined as the set of procedures and safeguards established to ensure that only authorized users can access a set of data. Assessing data security practices allows for an understanding of how strictly data privacy rights are enforced. Unauthorized access and data security are not the only issues at stake when considering data privacy. Health-related data gathered from a user can be shared with third parties in various ways. For example, the user may share information with their physician, insurance company, family, and friends, similar to how other information is shared in social networks. This is already happening—many companies offering direct-to-consumer genetic analyses for discovering ancestry or health-related information, such as the presence of genetic markers associated with specific diseases, already offer different degrees of data sharing functions, including the option to share personal data with third parties. Personal health-related data can also be shared in aggregated and anonymized forms for research purposes. This was the case in the Genographic Project [23], a genetic anthropological population study launched in 2005 by the National Geographic Society. In summary, mHealth apps enable the widespread collection of a wealth of health-related information. Assuming that data privacy and data protection are fundamental human rights, including the right to understand and control which personal data are collected, who collects them, and how and by whom they are used, it is imperative to understand what privacy rights are recognized in practice and how they are enforced. **[RenderX](http://www.renderx.com/)** JMIR MHEALTH AND UHEALTH Alfawzan et al adequately specific. The primary database search aimed to minimize the number of false-negative results (ie, missing important apps) at the expense of considerable false-positive results (ie, apps that would later be screened out because they did not satisfy the purpose of the analysis). Textbox 1 presents the resulting search string; the 2 components were combined using the OR function. The search focused on apps available in either the Apple App Store or Google Play. The search procedure made use of the mobile app database 42matters, a private company that provides app intelligence and mobile audience data. In the database, the search strings were categorized to be more specific. In the database search interface, we applied our search terms as **Textbox 1.** Search strings used in the database search. **Central notion and search string** - Focus on females - woman OR women OR feminine OR female - Focus on health - health OR medical OR medicine **Table 1.** Information collected from identified apps. Information type Description App name Name of the app on the market detailed in Textbox 1. The database provided more specific filters for searching. The first filter was applied in the search field for _description_, _developer name_, and _title_ . For the second filter, the Interactive Advertising Bureau (Interactive Advertising Bureau categories are an industry-standard taxonomy for content categorization that was used by the database), _medical health_ was chosen. The third filter was the genre, for which _medical_ and _health and fitness_ were selected. The fourth filter was the match style of words, for which _exact match_ was chosen. The search performed by the first author (NF) in January 2021 yielded a total of 136 apps from which various pieces of information were collected to allow further screening of the apps (Table 1). Description Description of the app provided by the developers Downloads Download frequency; orders of magnitude: 500, 1000, 5000, 10,000, 50,000, 100,000, 500,000, 1,000,000, 5,000,000, 10,000,000, 50,000,000, and 100,000,000. For screening and selection, the logarithm to the base 10 of the download numbers was used because most download information was available only in orders of magnitude, as explained in the _Methods_ ( _Screening and Selection_ section) Rating User rating. Mean rating (between 1 and 5; 1: lowest, 5: highest) Title Title of the app Specific search terms All keywords that categorize the app Developer Developer’s name Rating count Number of ratings the app has received from users. For screening and selection, the logarithm to the base 10 of the rating frequency was used Language (default) Languages that have been provided by the app Market status Whether the app has been published on the market Website The app’s website Interactive Advertising Interactive Advertising Bureau categories are an industry-standard taxonomy for content categorization used by the Bureau category database **Screening and Selection** The scoping review focused on apps with certain characteristics such as an adequate number of downloads and a sufficiently large number of ratings by app users. To determine statistically plausible cutoff values for the selection of apps to include in a detailed analysis, a statistical analysis was performed on the connection among download frequency, rating frequency, and actual rating values. The primary search indicated that the identified apps fell into 2 categories defined by the app providers, Apple App Store and Google Play. _Health and fitness_ was the more general category, and _medical_ was the more specific category. Of the 163 apps identified in the search, 43 (26.4%) were characterized as _health_ _and fitness_ and 93 (57.1%) were characterized as _medical_ . The categories did not have sharp boundaries regarding the actual use of the apps; for example, some menstrual cycle tracker apps fell into the _health and fitness_ category, whereas others were in the _medical_ category. This was because some apps had https://mhealth.jmir.org/2022/5/e33735 JMIR Mhealth Uhealth 2022 | vol. 10 | iss. 5 | e33735 | p. 4 _(page number not for citation purposes)_ **[RenderX](http://www.renderx.com/)** JMIR MHEALTH AND UHEALTH Alfawzan et al additional functionalities, making them more health-oriented than others. The analysis relied on the categorization provided by the app providers. From a statistical point of view, the 2 categories differed substantially concerning download frequency. The mean logarithm of _health and fitness_ apps was 4.2 (ie, approximately 15,000 downloads; SD 1.8), whereas the mean logarithm of _medical_ apps was 2.9 (ie, approximately 800 downloads; SD 1.5), which presented a significant difference ( _P_ <.001). The rating frequency distribution displayed a typical long-tail behavior in that many apps yielded only a few ratings and few apps yielded many ratings. Overall, _health and fitness_ apps yielded more ratings than _medical_ apps; 40% (37/93) of the _medical_ apps and 16% (7/43) of the _health and fitness_ apps did not produce any ratings. When excluding the apps without ratings and focusing on the mean ratings the apps received, a weak correlation was observed [25] between download quantity and the app ratings ( _r_ =0.29; _P_ =.005) and between the number of ratings and the app ratings ( _r_ =0.32; _P_ =.002). In other words, apps that were downloaded and rated more often had higher ratings. This is crucial, given that apps related to general health were downloaded much more often than medical apps; thus, conducting a direct comparison of both groups regarding quality would not make sense. On the basis of this analysis, we concluded that the 2 categories needed separate cutoff values for choosing the apps for the qualitative analysis. The main reasons for choosing the cutoff values were that (1) a low download frequency indicated less popular apps, (2) a low rating frequency led to a higher variance in ratings, and (3) download and rating frequencies were strongly correlated. Therefore, rating variances independent of rating frequencies were examined to identify cutoff values separately for the 2 app categories. For each app, the pair (logarithm of the rating frequency and rating value) was evaluated. These number pairs were ordered in terms of rating frequency (lowest to highest), the rating value variance per bin was calculated for each bin size (starting with **Table 2.** Exclusion criteria. Description Language The app must be available in English. 5, ending with 25, sliding window approach), and the distributions were verified visually. For the _health and fitness_ apps, a distinct decrease in the rating value variance was observed at bin size 21. This meant that upon reaching the 21st item of the list, the variance dropped. The logarithm of the rating frequency of this bin size was 2.86; thus, the rating frequency should be approximately ≥ 720. Of the 43 _health and fitness_ apps, 16 (37%) fulfilled this criterion. A sensitivity analysis revealed that the apps not chosen in the sequence had 540 and 227 ratings, making it plausible to assume that the result was not strongly affected by a different criterion. For the _medical_ apps, we used the same rating variance value as that used for the _health and fitness_ apps. The same reasoning identified bin size 39 as the cutoff value, for which the logarithm of the rating frequency was ≥ 2, resulting in the selection of 18 apps that had at least 100 ratings. In total, of 163 apps, 34 (20.9%) were selected for further analysis. A sensitivity analysis revealed that the apps had 82, 78, and 45 ratings, supporting the plausibility of the cutoff criterion. In summary, 34 apps were chosen on the basis of the statistical criterion and were further analyzed using the exclusion criteria in Table 2. Using these criteria, 4 medical consulting apps were excluded because users were required to be associated with a specific hospital in a certain region or country. In addition, 4 other apps were excluded because they were not available in English, although the store page showed that they were available in English. Then, 1 app was not available in the Apple App Store at the time of our analysis because there was no update for the iPhone 11 (software version 14.4; Apple Inc). The same app downloaded from Google Play crashed after opening. In addition, 1 app did not provide a service related to women’s health. Lastly, 1 app was no longer available in the store. In summary, of the 34 apps, 11 (32%) were excluded, and 23 (68%) remained for the final analysis. Figure 1 provides an overview of the search and selection process including the number of apps identified. Time Frame The app must be functional in the search period (January to March 2021). Service The app must provide a service related to women’s health, not only access to information (such as articles or magazines) or a game related to one of the topics described by the search string. https://mhealth.jmir.org/2022/5/e33735 JMIR Mhealth Uhealth 2022 | vol. 10 | iss. 5 | e33735 | p. 5 _(page number not for citation purposes)_ **[RenderX](http://www.renderx.com/)** JMIR MHEALTH AND UHEALTH Alfawzan et al **Figure 1.** PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) flowchart outlining the search and selection procedure. **App Analysis** In the last step, the 23 identified apps were downloaded and assessed independently by 2 reviewers (the first [NF] and third author [GS]). Apps on Google Play were assessed in LDPlayer 4 (Xuanxi International Co), a PC framework software that allows Android apps to run on a computer. LDPlayer 4 emulates a Samsung A908N tablet and uses Android 7.1.2 (security patch October 5, 2017, kernel 3.18.48). Apple App Store apps were analyzed on an iPhone 11 (software version 14.4). All apps were downloaded and tested between February and March 2021. One of the main differences between the Apple App Store and Google Play is that the Apple App Store has the option to review an app’s privacy policy before downloading the app. This option is not available in Google Play. However, Google Play includes a Pan European Game Information (PEGI) score, which is a rating system developed and intended to assess the appropriateness of video games, considering the presence of bad language, discrimination, drugs, fear, gambling, sex, violence, and in-game purchases [26]. Nevertheless, the PEGI score does not always provide useful information on the appropriateness of apps for certain age groups. PEGI scores can be inconsistent; for example, apps for lung cancer screening and abortion are both rated as PEGI 3. In addition, the PEGI age limit often contradicts age limits specified within privacy policies or terms and conditions. The downloaded apps were assessed manually by 2 independent reviewers against a variety of user data privacy, data sharing, and security assessment criteria. These criteria, presented in Table 3, were selected from 2 studies that focused on app security and privacy assessments [27,28]. The selected assessment criteria were developed in compliance with the European Union (EU) GDPR. The assessment questions were categorized into several domains: privacy policy, data gathering, data sharing, security, and transparency. Our assessment was based on _yes_ and _no_ answers. In some cases, it was not clear if the criteria applied, so _not applicable_ was used as a response for vague statements or if the question was not answered. In addition, a qualitative portion of the assessment was included for each question, which allowed the reviewers to add comments detailing their observations. These comments are not included in Table 3 but are included in the _Results_ section. This review assessed each app’s privacy policy, if it existed, by screening each app manually after downloading. In this analysis step, the apps were evaluated using the assessment questions listed in Table 3. https://mhealth.jmir.org/2022/5/e33735 JMIR Mhealth Uhealth 2022 | vol. 10 | iss. 5 | e33735 | p. 6 _(page number not for citation purposes)_ **[RenderX](http://www.renderx.com/)** JMIR MHEALTH AND UHEALTH Alfawzan et al **Table 3.** Data privacy, sharing, and security assessment results (N=23).

Of the 23 apps, 1 (4%) was available in English only on Google Play but not on the Apple App Store. Therefore, we analyzed the app only on Google Play. Of the 23 apps reviewed, 7 (30%) did not have a privacy policy available within the app, whereas 4 (17%) had a privacy policy available on the Apple App Store page before downloading the app. As Google Play does not require the privacy policy to be included on the page displayed before downloading the app, Google Play users cannot read the privacy policy beforehand. The other 13% (3/23) of the apps did not have privacy policies either within the app or before downloading the app. In addition, of the 23 apps, 1 (4%) had a privacy policy after creating an account, but the privacy policy was not accessible anywhere else in the app. In 4% (1/23) of the apps, the link led to the privacy policy on the app website. However, on the website, the privacy policy was available on another page. Thus, reaching the privacy policy requires a long process; the user must go through the main website and search for it, and at least four clicks were required to find it. Therefore, users who want to read the privacy policy cannot reach it directly from the app page on the store or in the app itself. Of the 23 apps analyzed, 11 (48%) provided their services in more than one language, including English, yet their privacy policies were only available in English. Only 13% (3/23) of the apps provided their privacy policies in languages other than English. None of the apps reviewed had a short-form notice (in plain English) highlighting key data practices that were disclosed in detail in the full privacy policy. Only 9% (2/23) of the apps provided options for viewing the privacy policy (summary view or full view) but not in a short-form notice. In addition, of the 23 apps, 1 (4%) included the privacy policy with illustrated pictures, but the privacy policies of the remaining apps were in plain text. Of the 23 apps, 11 (48%) had specifications in their privacy policies related to certain laws and regulations, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act, the EU GDPR, and the UK Data Protection Act 2018). Of the 23 apps, 4 (17%) did not provide any contact information to address users’ questions regarding the privacy policy, whereas 3 (13%) did not have a privacy policy at all. A total of 48% (11/23) of the apps did not require explicit consent to the privacy policy. The welcome page of 4% (1/23) of the apps provided an option to read the privacy policy; however, clicking or consenting was not required before entering the app. Among the 52% (12/23) of the apps that required consent, only 8% (1/12) displayed the consent requirement at the welcome page with transparent options (the welcome page provided 4 options for consent, and they had to be accepted to https://mhealth.jmir.org/2022/5/e33735 JMIR Mhealth Uhealth 2022 | vol. 10 | iss. 5 | e33735 | p. 10 _(page number not for citation purposes)_ **[RenderX](http://www.renderx.com/)** JMIR MHEALTH AND UHEALTH Alfawzan et al enter and use the app). Another app prompted the user to accept the privacy policy; however, the privacy policy did not exist—it was not available in the app, store, or website. We considered this to be a pseudoconsent. The welcome pages of 3 other apps asked personal and health questions and would not allow the user to move to the next page without filling in all fields, but consent was not required until the second page. One app’s privacy policy had an option to “expressly agree,” but the form was accessible only after registration, whereas another app’s welcome page had a large button to “get started,” under which was written in smaller font that by tapping “get started,” the user was stating “I consent to the privacy policy.” **Data Gathering** We found that 17% (4/23) of the apps provided different age restrictions on the Apple App Store compared with those on Google Play; of the 23 apps, 3 (13%) showed different ages on the app store pages and in their privacy policies, and 2 (9%) did not provide any age restrictions. Only 35% (8/23) of the apps had privacy policies that stated that users under a certain age should have parental consent. All apps in the study required the entry of sensitive health-related data and personal information. Of the 23 apps, 1 (4%) also asked for information about the children, such as the child’s age and overall health-related questions. Only 9% (2/23) of the apps did not collect sensitive data, such as personal data that directly identified the user (eg, name, surname, email address, date of birth, and mobile phone number). Of the 23 apps, 11 (48%) collected personal data once the user started using the app without any registration, whereas 9 (39%) required no consent before using the app. **Data Sharing, Security, and Transparency** Of the 23 apps, 7 (30%) did not provide the user an option to delete past data by request, such as by sending an email, and 3 (13%) did not allow the user to opt out or withdraw by deleting the app. Of the 23 apps, 3 (13%) others did not provide any information on requesting to opt out or withdraw by deleting the app. All apps allowed behavioral tracking, whereas only 4% (1/23) of the apps gave the user the ability to opt out. Of the 23 apps, 7 (30%) did not allow location tracking, and 2 (9%) other apps did not provide any information about location tracking. Of the 23 apps, 20 (87%) shared user data with third parties, 9 (39%) did not require explicit consent to share user data with third parties, and 3 (13%) did not provide any information in their privacy policies and did not require consent related to the sharing of user data with third parties. We found that 78% (18/23) of the apps shared personal data for research purposes, 33% (6/18) of which did not require user consent, and 65% (15/23) of the apps shared data with a third party for tracking and analysis. In total, of the 23 apps, 20 (87%) shared user information if required by law. Of these 20 apps, 9 (45%) did not require user consent; 2 (10%) did not require user consent and did not provide a clear statement in their privacy policies disclosing whether they share user information; and 1 (5%) did not have a privacy policy. Among the 23 apps reviewed, 16 (70%) were transparent about how they processed the data, and 6 (26%) did not share any information regarding how the data were processed. Of the 23 apps, 8 (35%) did not provide information regarding how users’ data would be secured. **[RenderX](http://www.renderx.com/)** JMIR MHEALTH AND UHEALTH Alfawzan et al a big audience for these apps [2]. Adolescence and early adulthood are important phases in the human life span, and the experience of potential violation of privacy on sensitive data can have a considerable impact. Our study was not designed to consider those aspects, but future studies should include the role of age and culture on femtech use. **Recommendations** It is evident that poor data privacy practices do not deter users, as demonstrated by the high number of users of apps with unsatisfactory privacy policies. This generates the following 2 questions. First, are women as end users aware of the privacy practices of the mHealth apps to which they provide their personal and health data? Second, do they know how their data will be used? Future studies should focus on measuring women’s awareness of mHealth apps’data privacy and sharing practices. It is critical to understand what data women share with mHealth apps, whether they understand the apps’privacy policies in their current forms and whether alternative forms of the apps’privacy policies should be made available. Consumers are typically unable to assess privacy, data sharing, and data security policies. More stringent regulations would require apps to adhere to defined standards for their policy descriptions and how they may or may not prompt users to accept their policies. Although not an ideal solution, privacy checkups should be easily accessible so that users can better understand policies in the absence of stricter regulations. Despite current regulations, such as the GDPR, protocols should be improved to enable users to examine and understand policies. An educational study on the relevance of data protection, particularly with artificial intelligence, was conducted on pooled personal data. Further studies could be conducted for cases in which clear and transparent privacy policies do not exist. We recommended surveying women with a short-form privacy **Authors' Contributions** policy to illustrate the main points while providing access to the full form. Privacy policies should be improved to include illustrated figures and photos in a shorter form to aid in the end user’s awareness and understanding. This is imperative for understanding the future design of women mHealth apps. The Apple App Store and Google Play, which are considered the largest app providers, should require that apps follow the regulations. It was observed that the Apple App Store requires privacy policies to be displayed on the apps’ store pages; however, this is not the case for Google Play. The Apple App Store and Google Play should be responsible for such regulations, rather than only reaping the benefits associated with mHealth apps. For instance, an app that provides services in multiple languages should be required to also provide its privacy policy in those languages. **Conclusions** This review and content analysis examined the most popular women’s mHealth apps on the market. The market for women’s mHealth apps is large, with millions of users worldwide; the mHealth app industry is growing, and the number of available apps is increasing. Women’s health is a complicated topic in many ways. In our analysis, we found that the most popular women’s mHealth apps on the market have poor data privacy, sharing, and security practices. Although regulations exist, such as the EU GDPR, current practices do not follow them. Moreover, other studies conducted on various dimensions of women’s mHealth apps, such as on reproductive health, pregnancy, and ovulation, have concluded that those apps have poor practices in terms of privacy, data sharing, and data security [6,17]. These poor data privacy and sharing practices generate concern regarding health and personal data. The studied mHealth apps lack basic data privacy and security practices, which is unacceptable, both ethically and legally.

      "_Methods_": "**Overview** The following sections describe the methodology by which women’s mHealth apps were screened, selected, and analyzed regarding their privacy, data sharing, and data security policies. The scoping review followed the methodology introduced by Arksey and O’Malley [24] and was adapted for this app review. The scoping review protocol was developed by the first author (NF) in cooperation with the second author (MC) in November 2020. The protocol determined the procedure for the initial app search, screening, selection, and analysis. First, the database search and app selection guided by the protocol are described. Second, the screening and selection procedure, which yielded a total of 23 apps that were subject to a refined analysis, is outlined. Third, the analysis schema applied to the selected apps is explained. **Initial Search for Women’s mHealth Apps** The purpose of this scoping review and content analysis was to evaluate and assess the privacy, data sharing, and data security policies of popular, publicly available women’s mHealth apps on the Apple App Store and Google Play markets, which are considered the largest app markets. As outlined in the _Introduction_ section, a considerable number of available apps focused on women’s health and functions (ie, femtech apps). Therefore, as a first step, appropriate keywords that characterize femtech apps were identified. The keywords were based on our literature search, which described the topic of our scoping review, as explained in the _Introduction_ section. Search syntaxes were developed that aligned with a general understanding of women’s mHealth. Different combinations of search terms were tested, starting with a more extensive keyword set to identify a search string that yielded a broad set of results while remaining https://mhealth.jmir.org/2022/5/e33735 JMIR Mhealth Uhealth 2022 | vol. 10 | iss. 5 | e33735 | p. 3 _(page number not for citation purposes)_",
      "_Results_": "**Overview** Our assessment included 23 women’s mHealth apps. Among the 23 women’s mHealth apps that we analyzed, 16 (70%) were related to fertility health, ovulation or menstrual cycle tracking, and pregnancy; 1 (4%) was related to abortion; 2 (9%) were related to breast and lung cancers; 1 (4%) was related to women’s mental health and self-care; and 3 (13%) were related to women’s health exercises (eg, pelvic floor exercises and weight tracking; Table 4). These categories matched those defined as the dimensions of women’s health in the Introduction section **Table 4.** Women’s health app taxonomy (N=23). Figure 2 displays the general characteristics of the 23 apps analyzed in this study. We plotted download frequency against rating frequency (log10 scale) of _health and fitness_ apps (black) and _medical_ apps (blue); point size is scaled with the rating value of each app. The figure demonstrates the (expected) strong correlation between download and rating frequency and reproduces the initial finding that _health and fitness_ apps are generally more popular than _medical_ apps (see the _Screening_ _and Selection_ section). The results of the evaluation of data privacy, data sharing, and security assessment are summarized in Table 3. Category Apps, n (%) Fertility health, ovulation or menstrual cycle, and pregnancy 16 (70) Abortion 1 (4) Breast cancer and lung screen 2 (9) Women mental health (self-care) 1 (4) Exercise (eg, pelvic floor exercises and weight tracking) 3 (13) https://mhealth.jmir.org/2022/5/e33735 JMIR Mhealth Uhealth 2022 | vol. 10 | iss. 5 | e33735 | p. 9 _(page number not for citation purposes)_",
      "_Discussion_": "**Principal Findings** The goal of this review and content analysis was to assess the privacy, data sharing, and security policies of women’s mHealth apps on the market. This scoping review was important because of the growing presence and use of such apps in the women’s health domain, as identified by both health sciences and the mHealth app market (ie, femtech). This review revealed important shortcomings associated with privacy policies and consent practices, especially in the case of women’s mHealth apps. The apps that we analyzed were the most frequently downloaded from the market and had the highest ratings. Through our review and analysis, we found that women’s mHealth apps collected and tracked personal and health data. However, their standard practices did not follow regulations, such as the EU GDPR. Data privacy and protection have been suggested as fundamental human rights. In this review and analysis, we sought to understand the practices of select women’s mHealth apps. Our results revealed poor data privacy protection practices. It is ethically unacceptable that, despite the existence of regulations such as EU GDPR, there are still gaps in data privacy and security practices. All apps included in our analysis collected personal and health data; however, the option for the user to give consent and read the privacy policy was not always available. The involvement of end users is essential, especially when personal and health data are collected. Not requiring the consent of the end user when collecting sensitive information is an ethical violation. Moreover, the use of a range of women’s mHealth apps is increasing worldwide [7]. Many available apps provide services in multiple languages, which allows them to be used by people who cannot speak English. However, we found that most apps provided their privacy policies only in English. Users who cannot read English are unable to review and understand these privacy policies. Therefore, users may give their consent without reading or understanding the privacy policies of these apps. The right of the end user to access and understand what they provide consent for is a basic right that must be upheld. The type of data collected by women’s mHealth apps is considered sensitive in general. In some cultures, women’s bodies and health are taboo subjects. Therefore, the collection of women’s personal and health data could have negative consequences in certain areas of the world [12]. Given the sensitive nature of women’s health, women’s mHealth apps should practice increased privacy rather than the poor practices uncovered in this study. Moreover, some women’s mHealth apps collected not only women’s sensitive data but also information on children and infants. These observations demonstrate the complexity of the standard practices of data privacy and consent. Finally, also the age of the users is a factor to consider, as younger women are—because of a generally higher affinity of younger people to health apps—likely to be https://mhealth.jmir.org/2022/5/e33735 JMIR Mhealth Uhealth 2022 | vol. 10 | iss. 5 | e33735 | p. 11 _(page number not for citation purposes)_"

INTRODUCTION Today scenario, big data [1] is now rapidly developing in all research and engineering areas, including physical, Medical Internet of Things (MIoT) [2], biological, and biomedical sciences, due to the rapid expansion of networking, data storage, and data collection capacity. The rate of data production has grown significantly in recent years. Many organizations are looking for cost-effective ways to store and analyses large amounts of data generated by a variety of sources, including high-throughput equipment, sensors, and connected devices. Big data [3] technologies can take advantage of cloud computing [4] to deliver major benefits, such as the capability to build, connect, configure, and reconfigure virtualized resources on demand with automated tools. Cloud computing is a new paradigm that is altering how institutions, businesses, organizations, and individuals see and use various software systems [5]. Organizations that use cloud based solutions don't have to host their software or manage their own servers [6]. The cloud computing is made up of hardware and software resources that are made available as managed external services over the internet. Advanced software applications and high-end server computer networks are used to provide these services. With the rapid expansion of computer, storage, and communication technology, the cloud computing [7] is a new computing model that may give users with programmable and shared resources. Cloud computing [8] providers link a huge number of nodes and network devices [9] to create one or more big data centers. Then they offer infrastructure, platform, storage, and software services, all of which are centered on data centers. The most well-known technology in the world is cloud computing. It offers a variety of services to its customers, and cloud storage is one of the most important aspects of cloud computing [10]. To store data in the cloud network, we can use cloud storage. As a result, the cloud will require sufficient storage space as well as sufficient speed to load data simultaneously. The cloud era is arrived! It's a game-changing invention that combines public, private, and business process outsourcing capabilities. Scalability, elasticity, and flexibility are all advantages of cloud-based services. User groups and cloud service providers alike are concerned about data security and privacy [11] in cloud computing. In the context of cloud computing, sensitive information covers data from a wide range of various fields and specialties [12]. As a result of the recent growth of new cloud technologies, privacy and data protection requirements have evolved to safeguard individuals against monitoring and database exposure. The study on data security and privacy in cloud computing systems is summarized in this publication. Figure 1 The Organization of Research Paper Framework International Journal of Scientific Research in Science, Engineering and Technology | www.ijsrset.com | Vol 8 | Issue 5 114 Dr. Nikhat Akhtar et al Int J Sci Res Sci Eng Technol, September-October-2021, 8 (5) : 113-152 The remaining sections of this work are organized as follows. The related works is presented in section II. We describe the cloud computing in section III cloud data storage in section IV. In section V, we present the security and privacy threats in cloud data storage. We are widely discussing the possible solutions for security and privacy threat in cloud data storage in section VI. We present benefits of cloud computing in sections VII. We conclude this paper in section VIII. In section IX, we present future work of cloud computing. This paper gives an organizational framework in figure 1 to clearly depict the general structure. II. RELATED WORKS Any hosted service offered over the internet is referred to as cloud computing. Servers, databases, software, analytics, and other computing tasks that may be operated over the cloud are frequently included in these services [13]. The act of operating workloads within clouds is known as cloud computing. IT settings in which scalable resources are abstracted, pooled, and shared across networks. In recent years, cloud computing privacy and security issues have been a popular topic [14]. Data privacy, data protection, data availability, data location, and secure transmission are the most pressing concerns in cloud data security. Threats, data loss, service disruption, outside malicious assaults, and multitenancy difficulties are among the security challenges in the cloud [15]. Users of this technology outsource their data to a cloud provider's server located outside of their premises [16]. Memory, processor, bandwidth, and storage are also visible and accessible via the Internet by a client. By focusing on privacy protection, data segregation, and cloud security, Chen et al. [17] investigated privacy and data security challenges in cloud computing. Data security issues are primarily at SPI (SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS) level and the major challenge in cloud computing is data sharing. This paradigm shift that comes with cloud computing usage is increasingly causing security and privacy concerns about aspects of cloud computing such multi-tenancy, trust, loss of control, and accountability [18]. Before consumers and businesses use cloud computing, users' security concerns must be addressed in order for the cloud environment to be trusted. The trustworthy environment is the basic prerequisite to win confidence of users to adopt such a technology. The assessment of cloud computing hazards was examined by Latif et al. [19]. In other research, cloud infrastructures are combined with unique services aimed at specific businesses. To put it another way, the cloud is designed to provide specific services to clients, such as cloud computing for manufacturing or cloud computing for health care [20]. Shynu et al. [21] explored several ways of secret communication, such as the secret channel, side channel attack, and fuzzy technology, addressed secret communication technology in relation to application situations, and demonstrated its benefits and drawbacks. Lo’ai et al. [22] presented a mobile cloud computing concept that may be applied to a wide range of applications. The proposed architecture can be used to store and analyse data collected by various sensors and IoT devices. In restricted circumstances, the obtained data will be transferred to the mobile [23] cloud model for analysis and making the best decision possible. Johanna et al. [24] looked into a variety of covert communication technologies, including hidden channels, bypass, and fuzzy technology. These approaches, on the other hand, are a type of non-mainstream technology and application, with a very limited application scope. Cloud storage is similar to cloud computing in terms of accessible interfaces, scalability, and measurement resources because it is based on virtualization International Journal of Scientific Research in Science, Engineering and Technology | www.ijsrset.com | Vol 8 | Issue 5 115 Dr. Nikhat Akhtar et al Int J Sci Res Sci Eng Technol, September-October-2021, 8 (5) : 113-152 infrastructure. It consists of four layers [25], cloud storage supplies data access services including data storage, data computation, authentication, and access control. Due to the characteristics of cloud storage, data security and privacy issues are inevitably generated in this process. Furthermore, the cloud provides the required administration and control capabilities to support (regulatory) governance [26] rules while also meeting the needs of multinational corporations [27]. Zhang et al. [28] provided a technical review of four SE systems, including searchable symmetric encryption (SSE), public key encryption with keyword search (PEK), attribute-based encryption with keyword search (ABK), and proxy re-encryption (PRES). Several SE technologies, including searchable symmetric encryption (SSE), public key encryption keyword search (PEKS), attribute-based encryption keyword search (ABKS), and proxy re-encryption keyword search, were summarised by Zhang et al [29]. (PRES). They just provided a technical description of the searchable encryption paradigm, with no relevant algorithms or performance comparison studies. Yusuf Perwej et al. [30] in this paper highlight the main Hadoop security, technological viewpoint and analysis that may affect big data. Moreover, big data [31] can be advantageous as a base for the development of the future technologies that will transform the world as we see it, like the cloud computing, Internet of Things (IoT) [32], or on demand services, and Blockchain [33]. Edemacu et al. [34] examined and analysed the security, revocation ability, and efficiency of various attribute-based cooperative electronic health encryption methods. The privacy protection technology mentioned in this study, on the other hand, is relatively simple. Yusuf Perwej and colleagues take a quick look at the technical components of IoT security. Because when only two instruments were combined in the field of medical care, security was a major concern [35]. Tara et. al [36] investigated several security service methods based on Blockchain, such as authentication, confidentiality, access control list, resource sources and integrity assurance, and discussed the challenges of security services. A Blockchain [37] controller, cloud server, and authentication server (AS) are used to establish a cloud-based software defined network (SDN). To obtain the secret key, researchers recommend that all users register with the AS [38]. Nikhat Akhtar at. al. [39] presents a comprehensive literature review of recent contributions focused on the Medical Internet of Things (MIoT). Medical Internet of Things-based healthcare services are expected to improve the user's quality of life, lower prices using clouds. In this publication, Jeffrey and colleagues [40] investigate the effectiveness of deep learning algorithms based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) [41] for identifying malware in cloud Virtual Machines (VMs). We concentrate on two key RNN architectures: LSTMs (Long Short-Term Memory RNNs) [42] and Bidirectional RNNs (Bidirectional RNNs) (BIDIs). Based on run-time fine-grained processes system metrics like as CPU, memory, and disk use, these models learn the behavior of malware over time. Bader et al. [43] conduct a thorough literature review to assess existing research on cloud computing security, dangers, and problems. This systematic literature review examined the research studies published between 2010 and 2020 within the popular digital libraries. III. Cloud **Computing** This section delves deeper into cloud computing. The Internet of Things (IoT) [44], or the interconnection of people, devices, and \"things,\" is growing as the number of information detecting devices connected to the Internet grows. The cloud service provider platform [45] generates and hosts an unprecedented volume of data. Many applications and services will be hosted in the cloud due to the cloud's high performance, scalability, and reliability. The word International Journal of Scientific Research in Science, Engineering and Technology | www.ijsrset.com | Vol 8 | Issue 5 116 Dr. Nikhat Akhtar et al Int J Sci Res Sci Eng Technol, September-October-2021, 8 (5) : 113-152 \"cloud,\" often known as \"cloud computing,\" refers to any type of remote data storage solution [46] shown in figure 2. To be clear, your data is saved on remote servers and may be accessed via the Internet, rather than on your hard discs or local memories. You can rent rather than buy your IT using cloud computing. Companies prefer to access their compute capacity over the internet [47], or the cloud, and pay for it as they use it, rather than investing extensively in databases, software, and hardware. Servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and business intelligence are now among the cloud services available. Cloud computing enables businesses to develop, innovate, and support business IT solutions with the speed, scalability, and flexibility that they require. There has been a substantial growth in cloud computing usage over the last several years as firms increasingly [48] appreciate the cost savings, easy scalability, and work flexibility afforded by cloud. The global market for cloud-based services is expected to grow to $436 billion by 2024, up from $326 billion in 2020, with over 64 percent of businesses [49] adopting the cloud in some way. Cloud computing saves businesses money on both hardware and software upkeep. By ensuring that our data is always available, an internet cloud architecture improves organization productivity and efficiency. Figure 2 The Cloud Computing 3.1 Categorized of Cloud Computing Several kinds of cloud computing models have emerged as the cloud has evolved. Public cloud, edge cloud, private cloud, multi cloud, hybrid cloud, distributed cloud, and community cloud are the different types of cloud computing deployments. Each form necessitates a different level of client control and offers varying levels of protection and privacy [50]. 3.1.1 Public Cloud In a public cloud, the cloud provider's whole computing infrastructure is housed on its premises, while the customer receives services via the internet. Customers don't have to worry about maintaining their own IT, and they can easily add more users or computer power as needed. Multiple tenants share the cloud provider's IT infrastructure in this scenario. Typically, the public cloud is highly [51] segregated to prevent cloud service overlap among different enterprises and to ensure each business's privacy and security. The public cloud's scalability is one of its International Journal of Scientific Research in Science, Engineering and Technology | www.ijsrset.com | Vol 8 | Issue 5 117 Dr. Nikhat Akhtar et al Int J Sci Res Sci Eng Technol, September-October-2021, 8 (5) : 113-152 most appealing features. Furthermore, most public clouds operate on a pay-as-you-go basis, meaning that users only pay for the cloud services that they use. 3.1.2 Edge Cloud To lower processing costs and provide more low latency experiences for consumers, edge clouds decentralize computing power to clients and devices at the network edge. Edge cloud [52] will be a one-of a-kind ecosystem of open and interconnected data centers, with data center operators and carrier alliances allowing it to reach critical mass Depending on the QoE objectives and resource requirements for a given application, the edge cloud can be located in any number of network locations. The location of the Edge cloud will vary depending on the perspective of an end-user, network operator, or application provider. 3.1.3 Private Cloud A private cloud is a cloud that is only used by one company. It could be hosted on the organization's premises or in the data center of the cloud provider [53]. The maximum level of protection and control is provided by a private cloud. This private cloud is exclusively available to customers of a single firm or group of companies, and the [51] organization has the freedom to build the private cloud to meet its specific needs. Administrative control, privacy, and security are all advantages of private clouds for business owners. Private clouds are often surrounded by high security firewalls, with only approved users permitted access. For businesses that deal with sensitive information or that have strict regulatory requirements, using a private cloud enables them to easily make any configuration modifications that are relevant to their line of business. 3.1.4 Multi Cloud Enterprises are attempting to de-risk themselves by putting various workloads in different clouds, hence a multi cloud strategy is the preferred model nowadays. The usage of multiple cloud computing and storage [54] devices in a single architecture distinguishes hybrid cloud from multi cloud. Some organizations also prefer multiple clouds, as each cloud may offer a different technology capability. Businesses may personalize and compartmentalize their cloud network with multi cloud. 3.1.5 Hybrid Cloud Hybrid clouds, as the name implies, are a mix of public and private clouds meant to work together seamlessly, transferring services and applications from one to the other. Hybrid cloud customers typically host business-critical apps on their own servers for increased protection and control, while storing secondary applications at the cloud [55] provider's location. With hybrid clouds, business owners can simply scale up their network infrastructure by leveraging the public cloud while keeping their data privacy, security, and access control in the private cloud. The hybrid cloud model is also preferable for hosting workloads that must meet compliance or data security standards. 3.1.6 Distributed Cloud Distributed cloud is a public cloud computing service that allows you to run public cloud infrastructure in multiple locations, including on premises, in the data centers of other cloud providers, and in third-party data centers or co-location centers, all while managing everything from a single control plane. According to a current trend, Gartner defines distributed cloud as the distribution of public cloud services to different physical locations, but the original public cloud provider is responsible for the International Journal of Scientific Research in Science, Engineering and Technology | www.ijsrset.com | Vol 8 | Issue 5 118 Dr. Nikhat Akhtar et al Int J Sci Res Sci Eng Technol, September-October-2021, 8 (5) : 113-152 services' operation, governance, updates, and evolution [56]. Distributed cloud speeds up worldwide service communication while also allowing for more responsive communications for any given region. Distributed cloud computing provides repeatability and dependability, as well as geo replication, which helps to save costs while also providing instantaneous fail-overs via remote replicas that may be reset in the event of a failure. Distributed cloud allows breaking complex problems and data into smaller pieces and has multiple computers which can be worked upon in parallel. 3.1.7 Community Cloud A community cloud allows a group of multiple organizations to access systems and services in order to communicate information between the organization and a specific community. The goal of this concept is to allow numerous customers to collaborate on community-owned projects and apps when a centralized cloud infrastructure is required. In other words, Community Cloud is a distributed infrastructure that integrates the services given by many types of cloud solutions to answer the specific concerns of business sectors. With hybrid clouds, business owners can simply scale up their network infrastructure by leveraging the public cloud while keeping their data privacy, security, and access control in the private cloud. The hybrid cloud model is also preferable for hosting workloads that must meet compliance or data security standards. Because of the exclusive user group, organizations do not have to be concerned about the security problems associated with public cloud. It is owned, managed, and operated by one or more organizations in the community, a third party, or a combination of them. The community cloud is scalable and versatile since it is generally compatible with all users and may be modified to suit their needs. 3.2 Services of Cloud Computing Cloud services are now available to satisfy almost any IT requirement. It's more about finding the proper solution to suit your business and personal needs than there is a one-size-fits-all strategy to cloud. Each service model represents a different component of the cloud stack with its own set of responsibilities for you and the service provider [58]. Figure 3 Types of Cloud Computing Service Models Infrastructure, platforms, and software that are hosted by third-party providers and made available to consumers via the internet are known as cloud services. Although there's great variety among cloud services, all such services have certain basic features and benefits in common, and all can be categorized into a few basic cloud service types shown in figure 3. 3.2.1 Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) is the service paradigm that your cloud technology deployment is built on. You can get on-demand access to essential IT International Journal of Scientific Research in Science, Engineering and Technology | www.ijsrset.com | Vol 8 | Issue 5 119 Dr. Nikhat Akhtar et al Int J Sci Res Sci Eng Technol, September-October-2021, 8 (5) : 113-152 resources like computers, networking, and storage through an IaaS provider [59]. IaaS gives you access to a scalable, state-of-the-art hardware resource that can be scaled to match your company's processing and storage requirements. We're using this infrastructure to provide your company's applications, software, and platforms while relieving you of the burden of administering and supporting them. 3.2.2 Everything as a Service (XaaS) The X in Xaas serves as a variable in the same way as it does in mathematics. As a result, this word might mean \"Anything as a Service\" or \"Everything as a Service.\" The name XaaS stands for \"everything as a Service,\" and it refers to a wide range of products, tools, and technology that are becoming increasingly popular as a service offering [60]. XaaS is frequently chosen by businesses because the as-a-service approach can reduce costs and simplify IT implementations. With every additional cloud service, an organization can shed pieces of its in house IT infrastructure, leading to fewer servers, hard drives, network switches, software deployments and more. The primary financial advantage of employing the XaaS model is that it saves money. The Internet of Things (IoT) [61] is another cornerstone of many businesses that need to function online, and XaaS is a major contributing factor to how well this works for you, too. 3.2.3 Unified Communications as a Service (UCaaS) In light of recent developments, unified communications as a service (UCaaS) has gotten a lot of attention. Unified communications as a service (UCaaS) is a cloud-based solution paradigm for all of a company's communication needs. This will typically combine tools like email, video conferencing, instant messaging and more into a fully-mobile suite that can be accessed from any device. UCaaS (Unified Communications as a Service) is a technology that uses cloud-based services to streamline enterprise communications. Through a partnership with a united communications organization, UCaaS provides collaboration features such as instant messaging, video conferencing, file sharing, and more. Businesses can save a significant amount of money by using UCaaS. 3.2.4 Software as a Service (SaaS) SaaS (Software as a Service) is a cloud service paradigm that gives you access to a fully functional software product that is run and managed by the service provider. The majority of SaaS solutions are end-user applications. The customer uses the internet to access those applications. Rather than purchasing and maintaining their own computing infrastructure, [62] SaaS customers opt for a pay-as-you-go subscription to the service. SaaS is the best choice for many businesses since it allows them to get up and running quickly with the most cutting-edge technology available. A web-based customer relationship management (CRM) solution is a frequent SaaS example. We are store and manage all your contacts via CRM [63] without having to upgrade the software to the latest version or maintaining the server and operation system the software is running on. 3.2.5 Storage as a service (STaaS) Storage as a Service (STaaS) allows businesses to consume storage as needed. Instead of purchasing and maintaining storage infrastructure, this service allows businesses to add, delete, or adjust storage requirements as needed, and only pay for the storage that is used. Enterprises, small and medium organisations, home offices, and individuals can use the cloud for multimedia storage, data repositories, data backup and recovery, and disaster recovery with STaaS. There are other higher-tier managed services that build on STaaS, such as database as a service, International Journal of Scientific Research in Science, Engineering and Technology | www.ijsrset.com | Vol 8 | Issue 5 120 Dr. Nikhat Akhtar et al Int J Sci Res Sci Eng Technol, September-October-2021, 8 (5) : 113-152 which allows you to write data into tables hosted by CSP resources. 3.2.6 Platform as a Service (PaaS) Platform as a Service (PaaS) is a cloud service model in which you use a service provider to access a combination of hardware and software tools. The most prevalent usage of PaaS is for application development. Customers can use the PaaS to get the developer tools they need to build and manage mobile and web applications without having to invest in [64] or maintain the underlying infrastructure. The infrastructure and middleware components are hosted by the provider, and the consumer uses a web browser to access them. PaaS solutions must have ready-to-use programming components that enable developers to include new features into their apps, such as artificial intelligence (AI) [65], chatbots, Blockchain [66], and the Internet of Things (IoT) [67]. The right PaaS offering also should include solutions for analysts, end users, and professional IT administrators, including big data analytics [68], content management, database management, systems management, and security. 3.2.7 Security as a Service (SECaaS) The Security as a Service (SECaaS) is a service given by a managed security services provider that allows businesses to free up security resources by having the service provider take full responsibility for security. Because it enables secure access to apps and services regardless of where they are hosted or when users connect, security as a service has become a key business enabler in the increasingly cloud and mobile world. SECaaS solutions can be scaled up or down as required and are provided on demand where and when you need them. That means you won't have to worry about deployment or updates because everything is handled by your SECaaS provider and accessible via a web-based dashboard. Data loss prevention, antivirus management, spam filtering, network security, identity management, and other services may be included. 3.2.8 Functions as a Service (FaaS) Before we can comprehend Functions as a Service, we must first comprehend the most commonly used technical word for FaaS server less computing. Server less computing [69] is a cloud computing approach in which developers are relieved of low-level infrastructure decisions and server maintenance. The allocation of resources is handled by the cloud service provider, so the application architect does not have to worry about it. FaaS is a new cloud computing service that is transforming many industries. It's a server-less computing idea that allows software developers to create apps and distribute particular \"functions,\" pieces of business logic, or actions without the need for a server. It increases the efficiency as developers need not to consider server operations because they are hosted externally. Examples of FaaS include Google Cloud Function, Microsoft Azure Functions, Webtask.io, Iron.io, Open Whisk, and AWS Lambda. 3.2.9 Test environment as a Service (TEaaS) The test environment as a service paradigm, which is an on-demand test environment, allows businesses to test their software or apps using only a web browser. Clients save money on the deployment of test infrastructure for testing, as well as the tools needed for testing and maintenance. Clients benefit from TEaaS since it reduces the costs of physical infrastructure, testing tools, IT support staff maintenance, testing resources, and so on. Concerns concerning cyber security in a cloud-based test environment, on the other hand, are a major impediment to the worldwide test environment as a service market's growth. International Journal of Scientific Research in Science, Engineering and Technology | www.ijsrset.com | Vol 8 | Issue 5 121 Dr. Nikhat Akhtar et al Int J Sci Res Sci Eng Technol, September-October-2021, 8 (5) : 113-152 3.2.10 Communication as a Service (CaaS) The “Communications” is represented by the C in CaaS. This means we'll use a single vendor to handle all of your communication needs. This cover, among other things, phone over IP, instant messaging, collaboration, and video conferencing. The supplier is in charge of all hardware and software administration in this situation. They usually charge on an on demand basis so you’ll always only pay for what you need. This means that this model is flexible and will grow as your need for communication grows. 3.2.11 Artificial Intelligence as a Service (AIaaS) Artificial intelligence as a service (AIaaS) is a third party AI outsourcing service. AIaaS refers to AI platforms that allow businesses to implement and grow AI approaches for a fraction of the expense of a full-fledged AI department [70]. The term \"service\" in AIaaS refers not only to the cloud-based software delivery model, but also to the extent to which the vendor is involved in the process. The nine yards of AI [71] are delivered as a unified platform by IT companies delivering AIaaS, from problem conceptualization to keeping the model on track and expanding to new use cases, through constructing the model, deploying the solution in production, and sustaining it in real-world settings. AI cloud offerings including Amazon Machine Learning, Microsoft Cognitive Services and Google Cloud Machine Learning [72] can help organizations what might be possible with their data. AIaaS solutions also provide more scalability, flexibility, and also use. 3.2.12 Desktop as a Service (DaaS) Desktop as a Service (DaaS) is a sort of offering that provides virtual desktops to end customers. It is extremely popular in the remote working environment. Virtual desktops promise robust security, as all information is stored on the server, and not on individual machines or laptops. The service provider is responsible for all data management, backup, and storage [73]. DaaS runs across a range of operating systems and device kinds, which promotes the trend of employees bringing their own devices to work and relieves the cloud service provider of the responsibility of supporting the desktop on all of those devices. Desktop as a Service (DaaS) has a number of distinct advantages over the traditional desktop paradigm. Deploying or decommissioning active end users with DaaS is much faster and less expensive. 3.2.13 Network-as-a-Service (NaaS) Network-as-a-Service enables us to gain direct and secure access to network infrastructure. Custom routing protocols can be deployed using NaaS. To provide network services to customers, NaaS employs virtualized network infrastructure. The network resources must be maintained and managed by the NaaS provider. Having a provider work for a customer reduces the customer's workload. Furthermore, NaaS provides network as a service. NaaS is also based on pay-per-use model. 3.2.14 Disaster Recovery as a Service (DRaaS) Disaster recovery as a service, or DRaaS, is the replication of physical or virtual servers hosted by a third party to offer failover in the case of a man-made or natural disaster. DRaaS can be especially useful to organizations that lack the necessary expertise to provision, configure, and test an effective disaster recovery plan. The goal of DRaaS is to achieve a quick recovery point [74]. This means that the data will be restored as closely as feasible to its current \"now\" state. Typical recuperation time goals are 4 hours or less, and equipment that are geographically located in a different place will be brought up. Third parties bear complete responsibility for disaster recovery under the managed DRaaS paradigm. Choosing this International Journal of Scientific Research in Science, Engineering and Technology | www.ijsrset.com | Vol 8 | Issue 5 122 Dr. Nikhat Akhtar et al Int J Sci Res Sci Eng Technol, September-October-2021, 8 (5) : 113-152 option requires organizations to work closely with DRaaS providers to keep all infrastructure, application, and service changes up to date. If you don’t have the expertise and time to manage your own disaster recovery, this is the best option. 3.2.15 Monitoring as a Service (MaaS) Monitoring as a Service (MaaS) is a security service that protects a company's IT assets 24 hours a day, seven days a week. It is critical in protecting an organization's or government's clientele from cyber threats. It is a framework that facilitates the deployment of monitoring functionalities for various other services and applications within the cloud. MaaS is an outsourced monitoring service with a flexible and consumption-based [75] subscription model. However, in order to monitor effectively and efficiently, the business needs have up-to-date equipment, professionals with extensive technical capabilities, and scalable security processes, all of which come at a significant cost. Online state monitoring is the most typical MaaS application, networks, systems, which continuously monitors particular states of apps, instances, or any other element that can be deployed in the cloud. 3.2.16 Model as a Service (MDaaS) A Model as a Service (MDaaS) is a service that allows you to run simulation models. The MDaaS is primarily concerned with the application of a model to data. The model can be pre-deployed, has a well known service endpoint, and extra data services may be available. This is a regular occurrence in operational models used in a production setting. Before execution, this model can be dynamically deployed from the client. Such behavior is required for the development of model services for research purposes. Both approaches cater to a distinct workflow, as well as the requirements for availability and security. Web services are used as the client's communication interface in MDaaS. Data is exchanged as structured text, such as XML or JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) in a specified syntax. However, data may also be passed to the service in the model’s native format. IV. Cloud Data Storage Cloud storage is a cloud computing approach in which data is stored on the Internet and managed and operated by a cloud computing provider. It's on demand, with just-in-time capacity and costs, and it saves you money by not having to buy and manage your own data storage infrastructure. Cloud computing integrates the concepts of [76] grid computing, distribution, and utility computing, among others, to create a vast pool of shared virtual resources by connecting a large number of computers, storage, and software resources. Cloud data storage is a type of data storage that involves sending data over the Internet and storing it on remote systems that may span several servers and locations. Cloud storage can be offered by a service provider, installed on premises in a company's own data center, or a hybrid of the two. Large data centers are maintained by cloud service providers in numerous locations across the world. Depending on the extent of the cloud provider's operation, the server with which you connect sends your data [78] to a pool of computers situated in one or more data centers. Using a cloud service provider's infrastructure to securely store your data, apps, and workloads is known as cloud storage. Users that want to adopt cloud computing are concerned about data security and privacy. This technology needs proper security principles and mechanisms to eliminate users concerns. 4.1 Cloud Storage Classes The concept of cloud storage is similar to that of data storage. Information is saved in logical pools in cloud storage, whereas physical storage necessitates a large number of computers and, in certain cases, many International Journal of Scientific Research in Science, Engineering and Technology | www.ijsrset.com | Vol 8 | Issue 5 123 Dr. Nikhat Akhtar et al Int J Sci Res Sci Eng Technol, September-October-2021, 8 (5) : 113-152 locations. Unmanaged cloud storage and managed cloud storage are the two primary categories in which cloud storage may be found. The storage [79] is preconfigured for the customer in unmanaged cloud storage. The consumer is unable to format, install his own file system, or change the properties of his hard drive. Managed cloud storage provides on-demand internet storage capacity. The managed cloud storage system appears to the user to be a raw disk that the user can partition and format. 4.2 Type of Cloud Storage Formats Cloud storage employs a logical memory paradigm, which enables providers to store your data on several servers in various regions while being completely transparent to you. People may now upload all personal data stored on their mobile phones to their cloud storage accounts with a single click using specialized software available for various OS versions. Dropbox and Google Drive are two examples of popular cloud storage options. The three most common forms of cloud storage formats are block storage, object storage, and file storage. 4.2.1 Block Storage Block storage, which is commonly used in SANs, is also widely used in cloud storage settings. Data is grouped into big volumes called \"blocks\" in this storage model. Each block corresponds to a different hard drive. Cloud storage providers use blocks to split large amounts of data among multiple storage nodes. Block storage is quick, efficient, and delivers the low latency that database and high-performance workloads require [80]. Block storage, when used in the cloud, grows effortlessly to meet the development of your company's databases and applications. If your website collects a lot of visitor data that has to be saved, block storage can be a good option. The primary disadvantages of block storage are its lack of metadata, which limits organizational flexibility, and its higher price and complexity. 4.2.2 Object Storage Object storage is distinct from file and block storage in that data is managed as objects. The data in a file, its accompanying metadata, and an identifier are all included in each object. Objects save data in the format in which it is received and allow metadata to be customised in ways that make the data easier to access and analyse. An object storage protocol uses the RESTful API to store a file and its associated metadata as a single object and assign it an ID number. The user gives the ID to the system to retrieve content, and the content is assembled with full information, authentication, and security. Objects are stored in repositories that provide almost infinite scalability, rather than being structured in [81] files or folder hierarchies. Object storage helps you to optimise storage resources in a cost-effective manner because there is no filing hierarchy and the metadata is customisable. The object storage protocol is used by all backup apps, which is one of the reasons why online backup to a cloud service was the first successful cloud storage application. The main disadvantage of object storage is that data cannot be modified segment by segment. Only the whole object can be changed, which has an impact on performance. We need to restore the object, add a new row, and write the entire object back into the object storage system. As a result, this type of storage is unsuitable for applications with frequent data changes. 4.2.3 File Storage The file storage method preserves data in a hierarchical file and folder structure that is familiar to most of us. It is often used with network attached storage and personal computer storage discs (NAS). Regardless of whether the data is stored in the storage International Journal of Scientific Research in Science, Engineering and Technology | www.ijsrset.com | Vol 8 | Issue 5 124 Dr. Nikhat Akhtar et al Int J Sci Res Sci Eng Technol, September-October-2021, 8 (5) : 113-152 system or on the client, the hierarchy makes it easier and more natural to search and retrieve files when needed [82]. Development platforms, home folders, and repositories for video, audio, and other data all need file storage. The primary disadvantages of file storage, if we plan for your data to grow, there is a certain point at which the hierarchy and permissions will become complex enough to slow the system significantly. V. Security and Privacy Threats in Cloud Data Storage Today, the cloud makes software, platforms, infrastructure, and storage more flexible and economical for businesses of all sizes. In this part, we'll discuss the security and privacy risks associated with cloud data storage. Security and privacy are broad topics in cloud computing. In comparison to traditional systems, the cloud has novel security requirements [83]. Because the consumer no longer owns the infrastructure, traditional security architecture is broken. When data is kept on a remote server, users lose physical control over it [84], and they delegate that control to an untrustworthy cloud provider or party. Because cloud computing is made up of numerous technologies, such as databases, operating systems, different networks, transaction management, [85] virtualization, it poses a number of security risks. As a result, security concerns about these systems and applications apply to the cloud computing as well. Privacy is a complex topic that has different interpretations depending on contexts, cultures and communities, and it has been recognized as a fundamental human right by the United Nations [86]. Other difficult challenges in cloud computing security include the formulation of a legal definition for cybercrime, the issue of jurisdiction (who is liable for what information and where are they held responsible for it), and the regulation of data transfers to third nations. Access control, user authentication, and data encryption [87] are all standard security features offered by most cloud storage providers. This means that there are significant security and privacy problems that must be considered by all parties involved in the cloud computing arena while employing cloud computing. Cloud computing has a number of problems. The following are the issues that need to be addressed. 5.1 Handle Access for Remote Work One of the most appealing features of cloud applications is that they can be accessed from any device with an internet connection. However, more apps mean more URLs and passwords to maintain and support, and the rise of mobile devices adds yet another access point to handle. IT departments must facilitate access across multiple devices and platforms without compromising security. 5.2 Privacy of Cloud Data The data on the cloud is distributed all over the world. The user has no knowledge of the location of data and has no control over the physical access mechanisms to that data. Many countries, cultures, and jurisdictions have vastly different ideas about privacy. When an investigation happens, there is also the issue of whose jurisdiction the data belongs under. There are several databases and applications in a distributed system. Governments [26] should have at least a rudimentary policy in place to deal with such circumstances. 5.3 Administrative Entrance Administrative access in cloud computing is done over the internet, which raises the danger. It is very important to control administrative access to data and monitor the access to maintain protocols. International Journal of Scientific Research in Science, Engineering and Technology | www.ijsrset.com | Vol 8 | Issue 5 125 Dr. Nikhat Akhtar et al Int J Sci Res Sci Eng Technol, September-October-2021, 8 (5) : 113-152 5.4 Access Control Data security must be given extra attention when data is outsourced to the cloud, which is untrustworthy since it is in a domain where security is not regulated by the data owner. When more than one entity wants to exchange data, a method must be in place to limit who has access to that data. The literature [88] has discussed a variety of strategies. Those techniques were proposed to keep data content confidential and keep unauthorized entity from accessing and disclosing the data by using access control while permitting many authorized entities to share those data. 5.5 Data Breaches A data breach happens when an unauthorized person or group of persons accesses protected, secure, sensitive, or confidential data. Users and organizations in a cloud environment all have access to the same data. Any breach of this [89] cloud environment would open the door to all users' and businesses' data. The attacker's primary aim is usually not the user, although the user is ultimately affected. Because of multi-tenancy, customers using different applications on virtual machines could share the same database and any corruption event that happens to it is going to affect others sharing the same database [90]. 5.6 Cloud Data Control and Loss of Transparency Consumers are ignorant of the data loss that is out of their control due to the cloud service provider's storage of data. The user's access to confidential data stored in the cloud could be compromised [91]. The user has no idea where, how, or when the data is handled due to a lack of transparency. To fix this issue, the user must understand what happens to the data. Cloud service providers are technically able to do data mining as well as data abstraction need techniques to analyse user data. As a result, customers can store and analyze data on the cloud with the help of a cloud service provider. The lack of transparency might also result in the loss of a significant amount of data. 5.7 Service Hijacking Phishing, fraud, and software exploitation flaws are the most common ways to steal an account's credentials and passwords, and they still work. Credentials and passwords can be reused, which increases the impact of such assaults. All the transactions achieve network traffic between user and cloud service provider. When an attacker acquires access to a user's credentials, he can listen in on the user's transactions and personal information [92]. 5.8 Denial of Service Because of the crucial services they provide, certain businesses require their systems to be available at all times. The cloud services provider makes resources available to a large number of clients. If an attacker uses all available resources, others cannot use those resources, which leads to denial of service and could slow accessing those resources. Customers that use cloud services and are victimized by the botnet could also seek to disrupt the availability of other providers. 5.9 Transmission of Data Data is transmitted from one location to another in a cloud system. Although encryption is used to protect data during transmission, most data is not encrypted during processing, and it must be unencrypted in order to be processed for any purpose. An attacker can find a place between communication paths. The attacker can change the communication. International Journal of Scientific Research in Science, Engineering and Technology | www.ijsrset.com | Vol 8 | Issue 5 126 Dr. Nikhat Akhtar et al Int J Sci Res Sci Eng Technol, September-October-2021, 8 (5) : 113-152 5.10 Lack of Trust and Dependence on Cloud Provider 5.14 Keeping Application Integrations Up to Date The availability of cloud services is a key issue. Due to a shortage of funds, the cloud service provider has ceased to provide services, and users may experience difficulties accessing their data. Some widely used cloud service provider, for instance Google Drive does not provide any contract between the user and cloud service provider. 5.11 APIs and Storage Gateways To help them migrate their data to the cloud, several businesses employ cloud storage APIs or storage gateways. Between the [93] user and the storage provider, these products serve as a go-between. They may make it easier for your employees to access and manage data in your cloud, but an insecure API or gateway could endanger your data. If you want or need to utilize a storage API or gateway, ensure sure it has a good reputation for security. 5.12 Sharing of Data The utilisation of data is rising as a result of data sharing. The data owners can grant one party access to the data, and that party can then share the data with others. This sharing can lead to major issues, such as data leaks to an unauthorized people. Therefore, during the data sharing especially when shared with a third party, the data owners need to consider whether the third party continues to maintain the original protection measures and usage restriction. 5.13 Destruction of Data When data is no longer needed, it is expected to be totally deleted. The data destroyed may still persist and be restored due to the physical features of the storage medium. This could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information. Enterprise cloud apps of today are built on cutting edge, internet-optimized architectures. Vendors can design their services and accompanying interfaces using the contemporary web technologies that underpin these apps. Unfortunately for the IT professionals, that also means that every new vendor may require a new approach when it comes to integration, particularly concerning user authentication and management. 5.15 Data Location Cloud providers have a slew of data centres strewn over the globe. Users of cloud computing need to know where their data is stored, hence data location is a problem. Depending on the jurisdiction, some countries compel corporations to retain their data in their country. Also, there are regulations in some countries where the company can store their data. Also, the data location matters when the user data is stored in a location that is prone to wars and disasters. 5.16 Latency Traffic congestion can cause delays in data transmission to and from the cloud, especially when using shared public internet connections. Companies, on the other hand, can reduce latency by increasing connection bandwidth. 5.17 Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attacks DDoS attacks aren't new, but they can be particularly debilitating when directed against our company's public cloud. DDoS attacks have a significant impact on the availability and security of key infrastructure in the cloud [94]. This form of assault can be crippling, causing systems to slow down or shut down. DDoS attacks also consume significant amounts International Journal of Scientific Research in Science, Engineering and Technology | www.ijsrset.com | Vol 8 | Issue 5 127 Dr. Nikhat Akhtar et al Int J Sci Res Sci Eng Technol, September-October-2021, 8 (5) : 113-152 of processing power a bill that the cloud customer (you) will have to pay. 5.18 Multi Tenancy The term “multi-tenancy” refers to the sharing of physical equipment and virtualized resources among numerous users. An attacker could be on the same physical machine as the target if this arrangement is used. Multi-tenancy characteristics are used by cloud providers to create infrastructures that can easily scale to meet customers' needs; nevertheless, because resources are shared, it may be easier for an attacker to obtain access to the target's data. 5.19 Virtual Machine Rollback Rolling back a virtual computer to its earlier state is a process. This procedure has additional security risks because it gives the user more flexibility. For example, a virtual machine could be rolled back to a previous vulnerable state that has not been repaired [95] or to an out-dated security policy or old configuration. In another example, a user could be deactivated in a previous state but still have access when the virtual machine's owner rolls back. 5.20 Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks Denials of service assaults are an old approach in the internet world, but they still pose a concern. Before operations are clogged by hundreds of thousands or millions of automated requests for service, they must be discovered and screened out. However, attackers have devised increasingly sophisticated and dispersed methods of carrying out the attack, making it more difficult to distinguish between malicious actors and legitimate users in a modern-day botnet attack. For cloud customers, \"experiencing a denial-of-service attack is like being caught in rush-hour traffic gridlock: there's no way to get to your destination, and nothing you can do about it except sit and wait,\" according to the report [96]. When a denial of service assault is launched against a client's cloud service, the service may be harmed rather than shut down, in which case the customer will be billed by his cloud service for any resources utilized during the attack. Cloud computing, on the other hand, has increased their popularity [97]. These assaults consume a lot of computing power and slow down cloud availability. The worst part is that there's nothing you can do but sit and wait once it happens. 5.21 Regulatory Compliance Certain industries, such as healthcare and finance, have to comply with strict data privacy and archival regulations, which may prevent companies from using cloud storage for certain types of files, such as medical and investment records. Choose a cloud storage provider that enables compliance with any industry rules that affect your business if at all possible. 5.22 Loss of Control Another potential security breach that can occur when customers' data, apps, and resources are housed on the cloud provider's premises is loss of control. As the users do not have explicit control over their data, this makes it possible for cloud providers to perform data mining over the users’ data, which can lead to security issues. Furthermore, because cloud providers store data in multiple data centers, customers cannot be certain that their data is truly deleted when they remove it. This could lead to data being misused that hasn't been removed. In these types of situations where the consumers lose control over their data, they see the cloud provider as a black-box where they cannot directly monitor the resources transparently. International Journal of Scientific Research in Science, Engineering and Technology | www.ijsrset.com | Vol 8 | Issue 5 128 Dr. Nikhat Akhtar et al Int J Sci Res Sci Eng Technol, September-October-2021, 8 (5) : 113-152 5.23 Cryptojacking Cryptojacking is a sort of cyber-attack in which a hacker uses a target's processing capacity to mine crypto money on his or her own behalf. Individual customers, large institutions, and even industrial control systems can all be targets of cryptojacking. Cryptojacking virus slows down infected machines since the mining process takes precedence over other legitimate tasks [98]. Cryptojacking has become a serious global problem, with cybercriminals gaining unauthorized entry to computer systems to make money with minimal risk and effort. Hackers are inventing new techniques to steal computer resources and mine for crypto currency, which is known as cryptojacking. 5.24 Accidental Exposure of Credentials In their phishing attempts, phishers frequently leverage cloud apps and environments as a pretext. Employees have become accustomed to receiving emails with links that may ask them to confirm their account credentials before gaining access to a particular document or website, thanks to the growing use of cloud-based email (G-Suite, Microsoft 365, etc.) and document sharing services (Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive). This makes it easy for cybercriminals to learn an employee’s credentials for cloud services. As a result, 46 percent of firms are concerned about unintentional exposure of cloud credentials, which could endanger the privacy and security of their cloud-based data and other resources. 5.25 Trust Chain in Clouds By ensuring on cloud providers, trust plays a key function in recruiting more customers. Cloud users rely on cloud providers to employ trust mechanisms as an alternative to offering them visible control over their data and cloud resources due to a loss of control. As a result, cloud providers genuine trust in their clients by ensuring them that their operations are certified to meet organizational safeguards and standards. 5.26 Cross Virtual Machine (VM) Side-Channel Attacks The attacker must be in a different virtual computer on the same physical hardware as the victim to carry out this attack. The attacker and the victim are both using the same CPU and cache in this attack. When the attacker switches the virtual machine execution of the victim, the attacker can learn about the victim's behaviour. An example of a virtual machine sidechannel attack and how an attacker can deduce information about a victim can be found here. The timing side channel attack is one kind of virtual machine side channel attacks. This attack is based on calculating how long certain computations take. This attack has the potential to leak sensitive information, such as the identity of the person performing the calculation or information from the cloud provider itself. Due to privacy concerns, the owner of the virtual machine can check other [99] virtual machines, making this attack difficult to detect. 5.27 Misconfigured Cloud Storage For cybercriminals, cloud storage is a valuable supply of stolen data. Despite the high stakes, businesses continue to make the error of misconfiguring cloud storage, which has resulted in significant losses for many businesses. According to a report by Symantec, nearly 70 million records were stolen or leaked in 2018 due to misconfigured cloud storage buckets. The survey also noted the advent of a number of technologies that allow attackers to discover and target misconfigured cloud storage. Cloud storage misconfiguration can quickly escalate into a major cloud security breach for an organization and its customers. International Journal of Scientific Research in Science, Engineering and Technology | www.ijsrset.com | Vol 8 | Issue 5 129 5.28 Snooping Dr. Nikhat Akhtar et al Int J Sci Res Sci Eng Technol, September-October-2021, 8 (5) : 113-152 their malicious actions such as the unauthorized collection of a user’s data. Without security precautions in place, files in the cloud are among the most vulnerable to being hacked. The fact that they are saved and transmitted across the internet adds to the danger. Snooping in network security compromises the privacy of a variety of data that should be kept private on a computer network. 5.29 Lack of Backup Services One of the most common concerns about storage systems is that they lack automatic backup capabilities. They expect you to back up the data you put in the cloud instead. This problem does not affect all storage providers; in fact, some will automatically backup your data for you. Those that do not provide backups, on the other hand, do not provide a safety net in the event of a sudden data loss. 5.30 Weak Authentication and Identity Management Data breaches in businesses are caused by a lack of adequate authentication and identity management. Businesses sometimes struggle with identity management because they try to assign access to each user based on their job function [100]. Enterprise cyber-security might be endangered by poor identity management. For example, cyber-criminals gained access to 80 million records containing personal and medical information as a result of the Anthem Inc. data breach. Anthem had neglected to implement multi-factor authentications hence this vulnerability was the result of stolen user credentials. 5.31 Trojan Horse A Trojan horse is a programme that appears to be useful but is actually destructive to the host PC. A dangerous payload is concealed in some areas of this sort of malware that can exploit or damage the host system. Trojan horses can also be spyware because of 5.32 Data Breaches A data breach occurs when sensitive, protected, or confidential information is copied, communicated, viewed, stolen, or exploited by someone who is not allowed to do so. As a result of the huge data held in the clouds, cloud providers are an attractive target for hackers. The severity of the attack is determined by the confidentiality of the information that will be disclosed. If the disclosed material is personal, such as health information, trade secrets, or intellectual property of a person or an organisation, the damage will be serious [101]. This will result in significant harm. 5.33 Synchronization Mechanisms Issues In cloud storage SaaS deployments, synchronisation methods are widespread. When files are modified on a local device [102], such technologies allow updates to be propagated to all other devices that are interested in those files. Tokens are commonly used to implement these procedures, which have been found to introduce new vulnerabilities that can lead to data exfiltration. An example of attack exploiting such [103] vulnerability is the Man in the Cloud (MitC) attack. Because of its propagation properties, this type of attack can be carried out on both an IoT device and a Cloud platform, allowing it to be used against other IoT [104] devices that use the same implementation. 5.34 Abuse of Cloud Services One of the most significant advantages of cloud computing is that it gives even tiny businesses access to massive amounts of processing power. Purchasing and maintaining tens of thousands of servers would be prohibitively expensive for most businesses, but International Journal of Scientific Research in Science, Engineering and Technology | www.ijsrset.com | Vol 8 | Issue 5 130 Dr. Nikhat Akhtar et al Int J Sci Res Sci Eng Technol, September-October-2021, 8 (5) : 113-152 renting time on tens of thousands of servers from a cloud computing provider is far cheaper. Not everyone, however, wants to put this power to good use. An attacker could take a year to crack an encryption key using his own constrained gear, but he could crack it in minutes utilising a network of cloud computers. 5.35 Shared Technology Vulnerabilities Cloud computing enables the sharing of infrastructure, platform, and software to provide services. Different components such as CPUs and GPUs, on the other hand, may not be able to meet cloud security criteria such as absolute isolation. Furthermore, certain apps may be created without the use of trusted computing standards [106], resulting in shared technology dangers that can be exploited in a variety of ways. Attackers have utilised shared technological weaknesses to launch cloud attacks in recent years. One such attack is gaining access to the hypervisor to run malicious code, get unauthorized access to the cloud resources, virtual machines, and custom subscriber data. VI. Possible Solutions for Security and Privacy Threat in Cloud Data Storage Many new technologies are rapidly emerging, each with technological improvements and the promise to make people's lives easier. Although cloud computing provides numerous benefits, there are still many [106] security and privacy issues. As a result, it is critical to understand the security and privacy risks associated with using these technologies. Data security [107] and privacy concerns are the biggest roadblocks to cloud computing are rapid growth. It's reasonable to be concerned about the security of your data when it's stored in the cloud infrastructure. After all, your documents, images, and videos are saved on servers that you do not control. You might be wondering if these servers are vulnerable to cyber criminals [108]. The security and privacy of cloud storage is a critical problem, especially if your company handles sensitive data such as corporate data, credit card information, and medical records, among other things. However, if you wish to store information virtually, we must consider the added risk that your information may be accessible to other potentially people who you do not wish to have access. Subscribers to the cloud want reassurance that their data is protected from cyber threats using the most up-to-date ways [109]. Layered security and privacy solutions for the cloud subscriber will be required, including endpoint protection, content and email filtering, and threat analysis, as well as best practices such as regular updates and patches. We require clear access and authentication policies, as well as privacy policies. In this section, a number of techniques have been proposed by in this paper for data protection and to attain highest level of data security and privacy in the cloud storage [110]. 6.1 Consistent Security Updates How frequently do you ignore the prompts to upgrade your operating system, browser, or email client? In the area of computer security, that's a no no. Such upgrades frequently include capabilities to defend your devices from the most recent viruses and malware. When you save your data on the cloud, however, the companies in charge of the servers should keep their security procedures up to date. We won’t have to worry about forgetting to run an update. Your cloud service provider's security measures will be updated on a regular basis. 6.2 Encryption Mechanisms These mechanisms are responsible for implementing the encryption technique that is used to conceal or obfuscate data. The majority use on key-based algorithms, which employ either a shared key or a public & private key combination. Tokenization, on the other hand, is a method of replacing anonymous International Journal of Scientific Research in Science, Engineering and Technology | www.ijsrset.com | Vol 8 | Issue 5 131 Dr. Nikhat Akhtar et al Int J Sci Res Sci Eng Technol, September-October-2021, 8 (5) : 113-152 data tokens with specified token fields. This approach is widely used in business applications such as CRM and other business apps. Data can now be encrypted in the database and only decrypted when utilised with an approved application and allowed user credentials, according to most database software. Another option is to utilise encryption appliances, which encrypt data as it leaves a private network and decode it when accessed by a trusted user. The encryption we use must be compatible with the capabilities of the application we're using and the cloud service provider we're utilising. Different mechanisms may have a considerable impact on the user experience, so the impact on end-user performance must also be addressed. 6.3 Formal Change Control Process The cloud is fast and secure for time-sensitive data if enterprises have a formal control process modification. If the organisation does not have a proper change process control in place during routine upgrades, the servers will fall down and no one will be able to access the data. And if the data is time sensitive than this cloud which do not have formal change process control, they are not safe for tie sensitive data. Organizations that execute changes and setup in a specially appointed way will probably encounter huge downtime in their condition. Lack of foresight and a lack of progress management are the primary causes of system outages. If the data you're sending to the cloud is time-sensitive, we'll need to work with a vendor who follows a structured change management process, avoiding the inherent risk of unplanned modifications. 6.4 Attribute Based Encryption For the first time, Sahai et al. presented fuzzy identity-based encryption [111], which is the origin of attribute-based encryption (ABE). In contrast to identity-based encryption, attribute-based encryption replaces identity with a set of attributes, and only users whose attribute set fits the access policy can access the encrypted material. The ABE algorithm is divided into four sections. The setup phase, also known as the system initialization phase, is where relevant security parameters are entered and associated public parameters (PK) and master keys (MK) are generated. The data owner provides their own attributes to the system in the second phase of the KeyGen step, namely the key generation stage, to acquire the private key associated with the attributes. The data owner encrypts the data using his or her public key, obtains the cypher text (CT), and delivers it to the receiver or to the public cloud in the third part encryption phase. In the last part decryption phase, decryption users get cipher text, decryption with their own private key SK. In data sharing applications, attribute-based encryption promises to give fine-grained access control over encrypted files, allowing the data owner to select who can access the protected data. 6.5 Access Control in Cloud Computing In cloud computing, access control is a critical security method for ensuring data security. It ensures that only authorised users have access to the cloud based data they've requested. In cloud computing, there are a variety of security techniques that allow for adequate access management. On separate network and cloud tiers, intrusion detection systems, firewalls, and responsibility separation could be deployed. Only restricted content is allowed to enter over the cloud network due to the firewall. Typically, a firewall is configured according to the user's established security policies. 6.6 Homomorphic Encryption Encryption is commonly used to protect data secrecy. Rivest et al. [112] devised a type of encryption system called homomorphic encryption. It assures that the International Journal of Scientific Research in Science, Engineering and Technology | www.ijsrset.com | Vol 8 | Issue 5 132 Dr. Nikhat Akhtar et al Int J Sci Res Sci Eng Technol, September-October-2021, 8 (5) : 113-152 results of the cypher text algebraic operation are compatible with the clear operation following encryption results, and it also eliminates the necessity to decrypt the data throughout the procedure. The application of this technology has the potential to solve the problem of data and data operations secrecy in the cloud. Gentry et. al. firstly proposed the fully homomorphic encryption method [113], which can do any operation that can be performed in clear text without decrypting. It's a significant step forward in homomorphic encryption technology. In figure 4 shown, the easier for us to understand how homomorphic encryption works in cloud. The data owner protects the data and sends it to the cloud server using homomorphic encryption. With the associated private keys, authorised users can decrypt the cypher text. User 2 just needs to send the functions corresponding to the operations to the cloud server if he wants to do certain specific operations on cypher text. The servers get operand and perform the operation without decrypt the cipher text and return the encrypted result to user second. Homomorphic encryption effectively protects the security of outsourced data. Figure 4 Homomorphic Encryption 6.7 Secure Data Destruction When data must be destroyed, it must be done safely. The hazards of data leaking are present if data destruction is not safeguarded. When data is not securely destroyed, anyone can retrieve it. If you store classified and sensitive data on the cloud and the vendor fails to properly destroy data from defunct equipment, the data is put at risk unnecessarily. A data deletion service's purpose is to fully obliterate sensitive or critical data. Third-party or proprietary software is used to make it possible. After the process, it is expected that data can no longer be recovered and used for any unauthorised or fraudulent purposes. 6.8 Multi-Authority Attribute Based Encryption (MA ABE) The figure 5 shows how many attributes are managed by distinct authorities. Each attribute creates an encrypted private key to prevent the authority centre from stealing it [114]. To ensure proper decryption, each policy authority has a master key. The total keys of the attribute authority are equivalent to the system's master key [115]. Figure 5 Multi-Authority Attribute Based Encryption International Journal of Scientific Research in Science, Engineering and Technology | www.ijsrset.com | Vol 8 | Issue 5 133 Dr. Nikhat Akhtar et al Int J Sci Res Sci Eng Technol, September-October-2021, 8 (5) : 113-152 Different colluding users can recover the master key, putting the system's security at risk. As a result, the contradiction between the system's correctness and security is a tough problem in ABE research. Because the central authority (CA) guarantees the operation of decryption, the research of multi-authority is divided into two categories first ABE with CA and second ABE without CA. In the standard model, Liu et al. [116] built a new multi-privilege cypher text strategy ABE scheme for cloud storage data access control system, which was shown to be self-adaptive and secure, and supported monotonous access strategy. 6.9 Encrypted Search and Database For the privacy and security of sensitive data in an untrusted cloud environment, an in-memory database encryption solution is proposed [117]. In order to gain access to the data, a synchronizer exists between the owner and the client. To decode the encrypted shared data, it receives from the owner, the client would need a key from the synchronizer. The synchronizer is used to keep track of the associated shared data as well as the keys. For cloud databases, Huang et al. [118] presented an asymmetric encryption technique. Commutative encryption is employed on data several times in the proposed process, and the order of public/private keys used for encryption/decryption is irrelevant. 6.10 AI Tools and Auto Patching Artificial intelligence, or AI, is also being used by cloud providers to help protect your data. This is critical, yet finding skilled security personnel to supervise data is difficult. Cloud providers, on the other hand, can use artificial intelligence to handle at least the initial level of security assessments. Built-in algorithms are used by these tools to look for and identify potential security flaws. 6.11 Encryption of Backups Data backups in the cloud must be encrypted; otherwise, data encryption is worthless if the backups are not encrypted. If these backups are not safeguarded with adequate encryptions, any hacker can gain access to them. Data is not secure if backups are not encrypted. A reinforcement that hasn't been tested is a useless reinforcement. In the generation condition, a decoded reinforcement overcomes the security measures. Data should be protected throughout its entire existence. 6.12 Built-in firewalls Firewalls are used by cloud providers to protect your files as well. This technology works in the same way as a wall, keeping your data safe. Firewalls, which can be either hardware or software-based, apply rules to all network traffic. These rules are intended to filter out potentially harmful traffic and keep your data safe behind the firewall. This makes it more difficult for hackers to slip malware or viruses past the security measures used by your cloud service provider. 6.13 Hierarchical Attribute Set Based Encryption (HASBE) Each user or data owner is maintained by a domain authority, which combines the properties of attribute set based encryption (ASBE) and hierarchical identity-based encryption (HIBE). The system can have five types of participants: the first is the data owner, the second is the user, the third is the domain authority, the fourth is the parent and trusted authority, and the fifth is the cloud service provider. To build the hierarchy of system users, the scheme employs the delegation algorithm. Rachel et. al. [119] proposed a hierarchical encryption based on attribute set, which extended the user hierarchy to ASBE. This system inherited flexibility and fine-grained access control in enabling composite attributes, as well as International Journal of Scientific Research in Science, Engineering and Technology | www.ijsrset.com | Vol 8 | Issue 5 134 Dr. Nikhat Akhtar et al Int J Sci Res Sci Eng Technol, September-October-2021, 8 (5) : 113-152 scalability of hierarchical structure. Wan et al. [120] proposed the HASBE system, which expanded attribute set encryption based on a user hierarchical structure's cypher text strategy while inheriting ASBE's fine-grained access control. Data owners and service providers are rarely in the same trusted domain in cloud computing. Further, [121] proposed a secure and efficient cloud computing data collaboration scheme based on hierarchical attribute encryption. This approach provided partial decryption structure and produced partial signatures by outsourcing signature calculation when users decrypted cypher text. A hierarchical attribute-set based encryption was proposed by Gokuldev et al. [122]. This system inherited not just the scalability of a hierarchical structure, but also the flexibility and fine-grained access control that ASBE composite attributes require. 6.14 Redundancy (ultra-backed-up data) What if there's a hardware breakdown or a power outage? Will you be able to access your data in the event of a natural disaster or a large-scale outage at your cloud provider. Because the majority of the world's largest cloud providers use redundancy. This means that they copy your data several times and store them on many different data centers. You can access your files from a backup server if one machine breaks down. 6.15 Hybrid Technique For data secrecy and integrity, a hybrid solution [123] is presented, which combines key sharing and authentication techniques. Using strong key sharing and authentication mechanisms, the user's connection to the cloud service provider can be made more secure. RSA public key algorithm can be used for secure distribution of the keys between the user and cloud service providers. A three-layered data security method is offered [124]. The first tier ensures the cloud user's authenticity through one-factor or two factor authentications, the second layer encrypts the user's data for security and privacy, and the third layer ensures quick data recovery through a fast decryption procedure. 6.16 Written Security Policies Plan The security of the data will be guaranteed if the cloud service provider has a written security plan of policies. If the cloud service provider does not have a written security plan of policies, the cloud is not safe and the security of the data cannot be guaranteed because they do not have a written plan of security policies. This indicates that they are working on a data security programme. Organizations that have not formalized their security strategies cannot be trusted with your touchy corporate/ client information. Strategies shape the system and establishment and without security is just an idea in retrospect 6.17 Ranked Keyword Search Ranked keyword search refers to the system's feedback returns sorted by relevant parameters such keyword frequency, which improves the system's applicability and meets the real-world need for privacy protection in cloud computing. To safeguard privacy, Sun et al. [125] suggested a multi-keyword search technique based on similarity ranking. Based on cosine similarity, this approach developed a search index based on word frequency, and the vector space model can gain improved search result precision. A cypher text keyword ranking search technique was proposed by Cao et al. [126]. They use \"coordinate matching\" and \"inner product similarity\" to quantify the similarity, according to safe inner product computation. Wang et al. [127] suggested a ranked search symmetric encryption (RSSE) system with little information leakage. This technique also created a novel encryption primitive that employed one-to International Journal of Scientific Research in Science, Engineering and Technology | www.ijsrset.com | Vol 8 | Issue 5 135 Dr. Nikhat Akhtar et al Int J Sci Res Sci Eng Technol, September-October-2021, 8 (5) : 113-152 many mappings to safeguard privacy and verify search results in order to search the encrypted file set. A multi keyword ranked search technique was developed to capture the correlation between data documents and search queries by creating a coordinate matching mechanism [128]. In addition, the scheme used the inner product similarity to quantitatively evaluate the related similarity measure. 6.18 Proper Usage of Administrative Privileges Administrative powers should be limited in cloud computing organisations, and administrative accounts should only be used when absolutely necessary. All administrator accounts should be inventoried using automated techniques, and each user with administrative access on laptops, desktops, and servers should be authorised by a senior executive. All administrator passwords should be complicated, containing a combination of digits, letters, and special characters, and should not contain dictionary words [129]. Before introducing any new devices in the networked systems, all default passwords for operating systems, applications, firewalls, routers, wireless access points, and other systems should be changed. Passwords for service accounts should be changed on a regular basis and should be long and difficult to guess. Passwords should be encrypted or hashed before being stored. Hashed passwords should follow the guidance supplied in NIST SP 800-132 or similar guidance. Administrator must use unique and different passwords for their administrative and non administrative accounts. This objective can be accomplished by enforcing policies and increasing user knowledge. 6.19 Data Concealment Data hiding could potentially be utilised in the cloud to maintain data secrecy. Delettre et al. [130] proposed a database security concealing concept. Data concealing techniques combine genuine data with visual false data to distort the volume of the real data. Authorized users, on the other hand, can quickly distinguish between bogus and authentic data. Data concealing techniques boost the overall volume of genuine data while improving the security of personal information. The goal of data hiding is to protect sensitive information from harmful users and attackers. Watermarking [131] can be used as a key to unlock the real data. Only the authorized users have key of watermarking, so the authentication of users is the key to ensure the true data to be accessible for right users. 6.20 Key Management Strategy This refers to the way you manage your encryption keys. There are already a number of cloud services that provide key management solutions, many of which are part of a broader cloud service suite. The drawback with these options is that you're still giving someone else power over your data. An approach that keeps the keys under your organization’s control, either through a key management solution or an encryption appliance, may provide better risk mitigation, especially in jurisdictions that have strict data localization laws. 6.21 Multi-Tenant The core of cloud computing is virtualization technology, which paved the way for multi-tenant cloud computing. Multi-tenant software is frequently installed on the same physical host, which might cause problems for other users, such as channel attacks. Because the virtual machine can be dynamically transferred based on performance and requirements, and access permissions can be changed, ensuring privacy protection is critical. Landuyt et al. [132] suggested a multi-tenant and flexible access control strategy that ensured strong data isolation for businesses in cloud stores. It can turn an employee into an unauthorised user with no access to others International Journal of Scientific Research in Science, Engineering and Technology | www.ijsrset.com | Vol 8 | Issue 5 136 Dr. Nikhat Akhtar et al Int J Sci Res Sci Eng Technol, September-October-2021, 8 (5) : 113-152 and ensure that cloud data is properly isolated Ngo et al. [133] developed a new multi-tenant access control approach based on the safety obligation separation principle. CSP may manage the security issues of cloud tenants such as addition, deletion, and management under this approach. Gonzales et. al. [134] proposed a service-oriented multi-tenant access control model that can meet the requirements of the users and automatic generate related roles in the cloud environment. 6.22 Strategies for Secure Transition to the Cloud Protecting what matters is the most important aspect of data security. Solutions that allow businesses to reliably migrate to the cloud while retaining most of their existing infrastructure and investments provide considerable benefits. By securing data inside the operating environment while setting security policies and keeping control through a centralized management interface, vormetric data security addresses the enterprise cloud security conundrum. Vormetric collaborates with cloud providers and businesses to protect data, regardless of whether it's [135] stored in physical, virtual, or cloud environments. Organizations can establish access policies and achieve complete control of data in private, public, or hybrid cloud environments. Only vormetric provides a complete platform for protecting both local data within the internal environment and cloud-based data within infrastructure or hosted application sites when moving to the cloud [136]. The combination of structured and unstructured data protection, as well as fine-grained user and process access controls that guard against unauthorized access to protected data. Because it is installed atop the file system and logical storage volume levels, the vormetric data security transparently secures data without needing application or database redesign or recoding,[137]and is transparent to users, applications, and cloud storage. In IaaS environments such as Amazon EC2, IBM Smart Cloud, Savvis, Rackspace, etc., enterprises can spin up instances to encrypt structured and unstructured data without rearchitecting or recoding applications. 6.23 Third-Party Security Testing Outside security organizations should be hired by the cloud provider to test their servers and software on a regular basis to ensure that they are safe from hackers, cybercriminals, and the newest malware and viruses. This outside testing boosts the odds that your cloud provider will have the defenses needed to keep your files away from hackers. 6.24 Reliability of Hard-Drive In the cloud environment, hard drives are now the most used storage medium. The core of cloud storage is the reliability of hard discs. Pinheiro et al. investigated the error rate of hard drives using historical hard-drive data [138]. They discovered that hard-drive error rates are not significantly related to temperature or frequency of usage, and that hard drive error rates have strong clustering characteristics. 6.25 Encrypt Your Data To begin, ensure sure your files are sent to a cloud service provider that encrypts data. We aim to make it as difficult for hackers to access your information as possible. The storing your images and files with a provider that relies on encryption will give hackers pause. They have an easier time stealing data that hasn't been scrambled. 6.26 Service Abuse Attackers can utilise the cloud service to obtain extra data or ruin the interests of other users by abusing it. Other users may misuse user information. In cloud storage, de-duplication technology is extensively employed, which means that the same data is International Journal of Scientific Research in Science, Engineering and Technology | www.ijsrset.com | Vol 8 | Issue 5 137 Dr. Nikhat Akhtar et al Int J Sci Res Sci Eng Technol, September-October-2021, 8 (5) : 113-152 frequently kept once but shared by several users [139]. This reduces storage space and lowers cloud service provider costs, but attackers who know the hash code of the stored files can access the data. The sensitive data could then be leaked on the cloud. So, proof of ownership approach has been proposed to check the authentication of cloud users. Idziorek et. al. proposed this question and researched on the detection and identification of fraud resource consumption [140]. 6.27 Perform Data Backups Ensure that you only engage with cloud service providers who back up your data. We don't want all of your data to be stored on a single server. If that server goes offline, you won’t be able to access your data. Even if you save your most sensitive data in the cloud, you should consider backing it up on your own external hard drives. This will provide you with an extra layer of protection should something happen with your cloud provider. 6.28 Access to Data Enterprise data must only be accessed and viewed by administrators, not by users. This access will improve the security of data stored in the cloud. Although many cloud apps are designed to facilitate client collaboration, free programming trials and join opportunities make cloud administrations accessible to unscrupulous clients. DoS attacks, email spam, computerised click extortion, and pilfered content are only a few of the actual assault types that can ride in on a download or sign in. 6.29 Enable Two Factor Authentication When you log onto a website using two-factor authentication, you must submit two pieces of information. Let's pretend we're logging into your bank's website. We begin by providing your login and password, as is customary. We next wait for your bank to issue you a code by email or phone. To gain access to your accounts, we are entering this code into the system. Hackers will have a harder time gaining access to your emails, personal information, or financial information if you take this extra step. 6.30 Deploy Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) The conventional username and password combinations are frequently insufficient to secure user accounts from hackers, and stolen credentials are one of the most common ways for hackers to get access to your online business data and apps. They can log into all of the cloud-based programs and services that you use every day to run your organization once they have your user credentials [141]. Multi factor authentication (MFA) protects all of your cloud users, ensuring that only authorized workers can log in to your cloud apps and access critical data in your on- or off-premise environment. MFA is one of the simplest yet most effective security measures for preventing hackers from gaining access to your cloud applications. In fact, most security experts will warn you that failing to deploy MFA as part of your infrastructure as a service (IAAS) design is now regarded careless. VII. Benefits of Cloud Computing To put it another way, cloud computing is computing that is fully based on the internet. People no longer need to download software from a server or a physical computer to run programs or apps; instead, cloud computing services enable them to access those applications via the internet [142]. Cloud computing is a type of computing in which software and services are supplied virtually across a private or public network. The cloud's fundamental goal is to provide cost-effective, adaptable resources to improve user experience. The practice of installing remote servers accessed via the internet to store, manage, and process healthcare-related data is known as cloud computing International Journal of Scientific Research in Science, Engineering and Technology | www.ijsrset.com | Vol 8 | Issue 5 138 Dr. Nikhat Akhtar et al Int J Sci Res Sci Eng Technol, September-October-2021, 8 (5) : 113-152 in healthcare [143]. The advantages of cloud computing are numerous and remarkable. Here are just few of the many cloud computing advantages discussed. 7.1 Time-Saving, On-Demand Services Self-service delivery is a characteristic of cloud computing for various workloads and requirements. Its allure stems from the fact that any service can be accessed on demand. This means you can gain new capabilities right away without investing in new hardware or software. 7.2 Sustainability Given the current situation of the environment, it is no longer sufficient for businesses to place a recycling bin in the break room and claim that they are helping the environment. True sustainability necessitates solutions that address waste at all levels of a company. Cloud hosting is more environmentally friendly and leaves a smaller carbon footprint [144]. Cloud infrastructures help the environment by powering virtual services rather than actual items and hardware, minimizing paper waste, increasing energy efficiency, and lowering commuting emissions. Based on the expansion of cloud computing and other virtual data alternatives, a Pike research report anticipated that data center energy consumption will decline by 31% from 2010 to 2020. 7.3 Flexible Costs The cloud flips the script on traditional capital expenditure investment, with the vast bulk of cloud spending being operational. Since a third-party vendor will take care of maintenance, a company doesn’t have to fund a support team to fix problem servers. The initial expenses of infrastructure requirements, such as the purchase of local servers, are significantly reduced. 7.4 Flexibility Clients benefit from a great deal of flexibility provided by the cloud computing. The cloud makes service testing and deployment a breeze. Customers can pick and choose which services they want and how much they want to pay for them. By providing a variety of services, cloud services can better meet changing business demands. If any application provided by the cloud is not getting our job done, we have the flexibility to switch to another cloud. 7.5 Easy Data Backup and Restore Data backup and restore has become a critical requirement for businesses as the number of cyber attacks and security breaches has increased. Cloud computing solutions can help you store vital data offsite, duplicate it, and restore it when needed. Traditional data backup and restore alternatives are available, but they are inefficient and difficult to scale. Cloud-based data backup allows you to save a large amount of data in the cloud and expand your storage space without the need for additional hardware. Most of the cloud backup service providers ensure that data is encrypted during upload and download. They also meet data security and compliance requirements. 7.6 Improved Mobility Apps and data may be accessed from anywhere at any time thanks to the cloud. All of this is attributable to the rising number of mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. The “anywhere, anytime” benefit also certainly applies to business. Employees gain flexibility, becoming more efficient with workflows and customer service. 7.7 Disaster Recovery Unexpected events, natural disasters, and operational hiccups are an unavoidable reality for which International Journal of Scientific Research in Science, Engineering and Technology | www.ijsrset.com | Vol 8 | Issue 5 139 Dr. Nikhat Akhtar et al Int J Sci Res Sci Eng Technol, September-October-2021, 8 (5) : 113-152 everyone must prepare. When such unforeseeable events hit, however, any organisation might suffer significant losses. While physical infrastructure failure can be remedied, the loss of data has a long term impact on an organization's structure and stability [145]. On the other side, storing data in the cloud protects all of your vital information from damage, even in the face of the most terrifying tragedies. With cloud services, you can count on quick data recovery in an emergency, be it a natural disaster like a flood or human-made trouble such as a fire or even something as simple as power outages. 7.8 Easily Manageable Cloud computing enables IT maintenance and management to be simplified and improved through SLA-backed agreements, central resource administration, and managed infrastructure. We get to enjoy a basic user interface without any requirement for installation and we are assured guaranteed and timely management, maintenance, and delivery of the IT services. 7.9 Increased Collaboration Cloud computing is primarily designed to enhance work operations, which includes data exchange between co-workers and business partners. Organizations demand more apps for file sharing and streamlined workflows. Remote workers can instantly connect and communicate with fellow employees and important clients. 7.10 Carbon Footprint Cloud computing is assisting businesses in reducing their carbon impact. Organizations only use the resources they require, avoiding any unnecessary over-provisioning. 7.11 Loss Prevention All of your valuable data is inextricably linked to the office computers if your company does not invest in a cloud-computing solution. This may not appear to be a concern, but if your local hardware fails, you could lose your data forever. Computers can fail for a variety of causes, ranging from viral infections [146] to age-related hardware degeneration to simple user error. They can also be misplaced or stolen, despite the best of intentions. If we don't use the cloud, you risk losing all of the data you've saved locally. With a cloud-based server, however, all of the data you've uploaded to the cloud is safe and accessible from any computer with an internet connection, even if your primary computer isn't working. 7.12 Economies of Scale Cloud computing saves money by taking advantage of economies of scale. According to a study by Booz Allen Hamilton, cloud computing could cut costs by 50 to 72 percent for a deployment of 1000 servers. Customers who use the cloud can save money by taking advantage of vendor economies of scale and reducing their investments in on-premises infrastructure. 7.13 Multimedia Cloud Computing Users can now quickly access multimedia information through the internet at any time thanks to the invention of cloud computing. After subscribing, the user can easily store multimedia [147] content of any sort and size in the cloud. Because the calculation time for processing media data is longer in complicated hardware, the cloud can not only store but also process media material such as audio, video, and image. After processing, processed data can be simply retrieved from the cloud via a client without the need for complex hardware installation. International Journal of Scientific Research in Science, Engineering and Technology | www.ijsrset.com | Vol 8 | Issue 5 140 Dr. Nikhat Akhtar et al Int J Sci Res Sci Eng Technol, September-October-2021, 8 (5) : 113-152 7.14 Operational Technology will never be perfect, but some of it is simpler than others. This includes cloud computing infrastructure, which is often hosted on separate servers by a third-party vendor. So, when problems do arise, it’s the vendor’s job to promptly fix the problem instead of having on-site IT staffs spend time and resources file claims or updating servers. 7.15 Quality Control Few things are as damaging to a company's growth as poor quality and inconsistent reporting. All documents are stored in one place and in the same format in a cloud-based system. We can preserve data consistency, avoid human error, and have a clear record of any edits or updates if everyone has access to the same information. Managing information in silos, on the other hand, can result in employees saving different versions of documents by accident, resulting in confusion and diluted data. 7.16 Multi-Sharing Cloud computing allows several users to share architecture and other applications. Multiple users and apps can operate more efficiently and save money by using common infrastructure when using the cloud in a distributed and shared way [148]. 7.17 Automatic Updates Users that use the cloud don't have to worry about keeping their software up to date. Instead of involving IT teams and forcing them to do a manual upgrade, cloud-based applications automatically refresh and update themselves. 7.18 improved communication Having access to instant messaging, conference, and video conferencing options through cloud computing promotes staff communication and cooperation. They can collaborate on papers and projects together, resulting in greater cohesion and teamwork. This is made possible by data centralization and real-time cloud server updates. 7.19 Real-Time Insights Millions of data points exist in your business data that can be used to improve it. It can be difficult [149] to assess how your firm is doing and what route to take next if your data is concealed in silos of data, on local workstations, or in diverse forms. Moving your business systems to the cloud allows you to get better visibility over your business performance, in real time, so that you can make informed decisions. 7.20 Processing Speed The practically infinite computational power accessible in the cloud allows you to reap the benefits of faster processing. Complex workloads that would normally take hours to accomplish on-premises are now completed in minutes. Websites will load faster, and video will render more quickly [150]. The possibilities are endless. When it comes to data crunching, processing speed is equally important. Using the cloud's near-limitless compute resources for services like big data and machine learning allows you to gain deep insights from your data much more quickly than traditional analytics. VIII. Conclusion Cloud computing is a novel means of delivering resources to users \"as a service\" over the internet. Cloud computing consumers no longer own the infrastructure that is completely controlled by these service providers, unlike traditional approaches that are based on hardware ownership where data is stored. You may sync your cloud storage service with your smartphone, tablet, or other mobile devices for International Journal of Scientific Research in Science, Engineering and Technology | www.ijsrset.com | Vol 8 | Issue 5 141 Dr. Nikhat Akhtar et al Int J Sci Res Sci Eng Technol, September-October-2021, 8 (5) : 113-152 convenient access while on the road once you've signed up for it and uploaded your files. Cloud computing is a computing model that enables on demand network access to a pool of configurable computing resources, such as networks, services, storage, and applications, that can be quickly supplied and released with minimal administration effort or service provider contact. Cloud computing is a new concept that allows users to access scalable and virtualized resources, such as bandwidth, software, and hardware, on demand. Although it has gained a lot of attention in recent years, the issue of privacy and data security is one of the key roadblocks to cloud computing's progress. In this article, we looked at numerous significant security risks for cloud computing environments from various angles, as well as the solutions that all users and companies should be aware of when selecting whether or not to use the cloud. This work contributes to the discovery of a solution for the security and privacy issues in cloud data storage that have been identified in other techniques, as well as the development of a novel solution or approach to secure the cloud. IX. Future Work of Cloud Computing Because of the flexibility of cloud computing, users will access and share their software applications online and access information via remote server networks rather than relying on primary tools and information hosted on their personal computers in the future. Cloud computing privacy and data security issues are constantly one of the key study topics for researchers and developers to find appropriate solutions. From the standpoint of this paper, we recommend that you discover the best and most appropriate privacy and data security solutions for the cloud services you use. Compliance, physical security, cloud migration, transparency, password security, data ownership, detrimental competition, and hostile insiders are all prospective concerns in cloud security that can be addressed with guidelines.

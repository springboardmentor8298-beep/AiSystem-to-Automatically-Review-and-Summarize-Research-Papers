Write the Methods section of a literature review on instagram.

Context:
Studies commonly use transformers, graph neural networks, CNNs, and LSTM models trained on Instagram datasets with supervised and self-supervised learning.

Describe models, datasets, and training techniques.
The tools are available for the use of the following training methods:
1. Schematic models of the neural network, including a neural network, and a neural network.
2. The data are presented in a "decompression" format.
3. The data are presented in a "decompression" format.
4. An algorithm for generating a neural network with a hierarchical model.
5. A neural network with a hierarchical model.
6. A neural network with a hierarchical model.
7. A neural network with a hierarchical model.
8. A neural network with a hierarchical model.
9. A neural network with a hierarchical model.
10. A

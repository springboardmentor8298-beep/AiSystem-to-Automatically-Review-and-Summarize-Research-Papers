        "abstract": "The introduction of Big Data Analytics (BDA) in healthcare will allow to use new technologies both in treatment of patients and health management. The paper aims at analyzing the possibilities of using Big Data Analytics in healthcare. The research is based on a critical analysis of the literature, as well as the presentation of selected results of direct research on the use of Big Data Analytics in medical facilities. The direct research was carried out based on research questionnaire and conducted on a sample of 217 medical facilities in Poland. Literature studies have shown that the use of Big Data Analytics can bring many benefits to medical facilities, while direct research has shown that medical facilities in Poland are moving towards data-based healthcare because they use structured and unstructured data, reach for analytics in the administrative, business and clinical area. The research positively confirmed that medical facilities are working on both structural data and unstructured data. The following kinds and sources of data can be distinguished: from databases, transaction data, unstructured content of emails and documents, data from devices and sensors. However, the use of data from social media is lower as in their activity they reach for analytics, not only in the administrative and business but also in the clinical area. It clearly shows that the decisions made in medical facilities are highly data-driven. The results of the study confirm what has been analyzed in the literature that medical facilities are moving towards data-based healthcare, together with its benefits."

        "abstract": "In theory, building automation and management systems (BAMSs) can provide all the components and functionalities required for analyzing and operating buildings. However, in reality, these systems can only ensure the control of heating ventilation and air conditioning system systems. Therefore, many other tasks are left to the operator, e.g. evaluating buildings\u2019 performance, detecting abnormal energy consumption, identifying the changes needed to improve efficiency, ensuring the security and privacy of end-users, etc. To that end, there has been a movement for developing artificial intelligence (AI) big data analytic tools as they offer various new and tailor-made solutions that are incredibly appropriate for practical buildings\u2019 management. Typically, they can help the operator in (i) analyzing the tons of connected equipment data; and; (ii) making intelligent, efficient, and on-time decisions to improve the buildings\u2019 performance. This paper presents a comprehensive systematic survey on using AI-big data analytics in BAMSs. It covers various AI-based tasks, e.g. load forecasting, water management, indoor environmental quality monitoring, occupancy detection, etc. The first part of this paper adopts a well-designed taxonomy to overview existing frameworks. A comprehensive review is conducted about different aspects, including the learning process, building environment, computing platforms, and application scenario. Moving on, a critical discussion is performed to identify current challenges. The second part aims at providing the reader with insights into the real-world application of AI-big data analytics. Thus, three case studies that demonstrate the use of AI-big data analytics in BAMSs are presented, focusing on energy anomaly detection in residential and office buildings and energy and performance optimization in sports facilities. Lastly, future directions and valuable recommendations are identified to improve the performance and reliability of BAMSs in intelligent buildings."

        "abstract": "Internet-based programs and communication techniques have become widely used and respected in the IT industry recently. A persistent source of \"big data,\" or data that is enormous in volume, diverse in type, and has a complicated multidimensional structure, is internet applications and communications. Today, several measures are routinely performed with no assurance that any of them will be helpful in understanding the phenomenon of interest in an era of automatic, large-scale data collection. Online transactions that involve buying, selling, or even investing are all examples of e-commerce. As a result, they generate data that has a complex structure and a high dimension. The usual data storage techniques cannot handle those enormous volumes of data. There is a lot of work being done to find ways to minimize the dimensionality of big data in order to provide analytics reports that are even more accurate and data visualizations that are more interesting. As a result, the purpose of this survey study is to give an overview of big data analytics along with related problems and issues that go beyond technology."

In particular, emerging economics view big data analytics as having great importance despite the fact that it has been in a constant struggle with the barriers that prevent its adoption. Thus, this study primarily attempted to determine the drivers of big data analytics in the context of a developing economy, Jordan. The study examined the influence of technological, organizational and environmental factors on big data adoption in the Jordanian SMEs context, using PLS-SEM for the analysis. The empirical results revealed that the relative advantage, complexity, security, top management support, organizational readiness and government support influence the adoption of BD, whilst pressure of competition and compatibility appeared to be of insignificant influence. The findings are expected to contribute to enterprise management and strategic use of data analytics in the present dynamic market environment, for both researcher and practitioner circles concerned with the adoption of big data in developing countries."

        "abstract": "PurposeThe study challenges the assumption of independence among Technological, Organizational and Environmental (TOE) factors and investigates the influence of TOE factors on Big Data Analytics (BDA) adoption among Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). Top management support was proposed as a mediator between technological and organizational factors and BDA adoption. Furthermore, the moderating effect of environmental factors on the association between relative advantage, compatibility, competitiveness, organizational readiness and BDA adoption was evaluated.Design/methodology/approachData were collected from 171 SME manufacturing firms and analyzed using the partial least squares technique.FindingsThe findings confirmed the interrelationships among the TOE factors. The effects of compatibility, competitiveness and organizational readiness on BDA adoption were mediated by top management support. Furthermore, environmental factors moderate the influences of compatibility and organizational readiness on top management support.Originality/valueThe findings contribute to the TOE model by challenging the assumption of independence among TOE factors, and future studies should use this model with more caution and consider the potential relationships between TOE factors."

As big data is dependent on the advancement of new data standards, technology, and relevant research, the future development of big data applications holds foreseeable promise in the modern day health care revolution. Enormously large, rapidly growing collections of biomedical omics-data (genomics, proteomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics, glycomics, etc.) and clinical data create major challenges and opportunities for their analysis and interpretation and open new computational gateways to address these issues. The design of new robust algorithms that are most suitable to properly analyze this big data by taking into account individual variability in genes has enabled the creation of precision (personalized) medicine. We reviewed and highlighted the significance of big data analytics for personalized medicine and health care by focusing mostly on machine learning perspectives on personalized medicine, genomic data models with respect to personalized medicine, the application of data mining algorithms for personalized medicine as well as the challenges we are facing right now in big data analytics."

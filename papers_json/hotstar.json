This study employs Stuart Hall's reception theory, which categorizes audiences into three groups in interpreting media messages: Dominant-Hegemonic Code, Negotiated Code, and Oppositional Code. This research uses a descriptive qualitative method by describing the research results using Stuart Hall's reception theory. In determining the informants, this research uses purposive sampling technique with the criteria of being female, currently or previously in a romantic relationship, and having watched the web series \"Yang Hilang Dalam Cinta\" on Disney+ Hotstar. From in-depth interviews with eight informants, six informants are in the dominant position, and two informants are in the negotiation position. Informants in the dominant position agree with the message of the series, concurring that gaslighting is a wrong and harmful behavior because it can make women powerless in a romantic relationship and lead to a range of negative impacts. Meanwhile, informants in the negotiation position also acknowledge that gaslighting is a harmful behavior, but they consider the educational aspect of the series. According to them, the presence of this series can provide examples of gaslighting behavior and its negative impacts so that women out there can have better awareness. \nKeyword: Gaslighting, Web Series, Women, Reception Analysis Stuart-Hall"

        "abstract": "Perkembangan teknologi digital yang pesat telah mendorong peningkatan konsumsi layanan hiburan berbasis streaming seperti Disney+ Hotstar. Seiring bertambahnya pengguna, volume review yang diberikan juga meningkat dan menjadi sumber penting bagi perusahaan untuk mengevaluasi kualitas layanan. Namun, analisis manual terhadap review dalam jumlah besar menjadi tidak efisien dan rentan terhadap subjektivitas. Penelitian ini membangun dan membandingkan model analisis sentimen menggunakan Natural Language Processing (NLP) dengan algoritma Naive Bayes dan Decision Tree yang diperkuat dengan teknik Adaboost. Metode yang digunakan meliputi pengumpulan data review, preprocessing teks, penerapan model, serta evaluasi menggunakan akurasi dan AUC. Hasil penelitian menunjukkan bahwa penerapan Adaboost memberikan kontribusi signifikan dalam meningkatkan performa model klasifikasi. Naive Bayes mengalami peningkatan akurasi dan AUC, namun peningkatan yang lebih signifikan terjadi pada Decision Tree. Hal ini menunjukkan bahwa struktur Decision Tree yang fleksibel lebih kompatibel dengan pendekatan boosting. Sebaliknya, Naive Bayes yang berbasis pada asumsi distribusi probabilistik yang sederhana kurang optimal saat dikombinasikan dengan boosting. Dengan demikian, Decision Tree dengan Adaboost menjadi pilihan yang lebih unggul dalam meningkatkan akurasi dan efektivitas analisis sentimen review Disney+ Hotstar."

Method: The research adopts a normative juridical approach with a statutory and conceptual framework, supported by literature analysis and examination of relevant laws and regulations concerning e-commerce and consumer rights. Results: The findings reveal that current Indonesian legal provisions inadequately address the legality and consumer protection aspects of third-party premium account sales, creating a regulatory gap in the digital marketplace. The analysis indicates the need for clearer legal definitions, stronger enforcement mechanisms, and updated consumer protection frameworks to mitigate potential fraud and misuse. Novelty: This study contributes to the growing discourse on digital commerce law by highlighting the emerging legal implications of intangible digital goods transactions and proposing a structured legal perspective to enhance consumer protection in Indonesia\u2019s rapidly evolving e-commerce environment."

The word embedding features used include Word2Vec, GloVe, and FastText. Our aim is to evaluate the impact of these features on the classification performance of machine learning methods such as Naive Bayes (NB), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and Random Forest (RF). NB is very simple and efficient and very sensitive to feature selection. Meanwhile, KNN is known for its weaknesses such as biased k values, overly complex computations, memory limitations, and ignoring irrelevant attributes. Then RF has a weakness, namely that the evaluation value can change significantly with just a slight change in the data. Feature selection in text classification is crucial for enhancing scalability, efficiency, and accuracy. Our testing results indicate that KNN achieved the highest accuracy both before and after feature selection. The FastText feature led to the highest performance for KNN, yielding balanced accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score values."

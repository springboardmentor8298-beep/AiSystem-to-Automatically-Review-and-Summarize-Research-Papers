  "abstract": "This paper proposed a total product lifecycle (TPLC) approach to regulating AI/ML-based SaMD, which focuses on the continuous monitoring and improvement of these technologies throughout their lifespan. Systematic reviews highlighted other potential benefits too such as improved scientific writing, enhancing research equity, streamlining the healthcare workflow, cost saving, and improved personalized learning in medical education3.",
  "methods": "LLMS DIFFER FROM ALREADY REGULAR AI-BASED TECHNOLOGIES LLMs differ significantly from prior deep learning methods in terms of their scale, capabilities, and potential impact. Here we outline the key characteristics of LLMs that set them apart from traditional deep learning techniques. Scale and complexity LLMs are trained on massive datasets and utilize billions of parameters,",

            "methodology": "of delivering media content that enables viewers to watch \nvideos without being restricted by conventional playback devices or fixed broadcast schedules. \nDuring the 20th century, the dominant mode of media distribution was broadcasting via over-the-air \nprogramming. However, with the advent of internet technology and IPTV in the 1990s, there was a \ngrowing consumer demand for alternative ways to consume content, leading to the emergence of VOD \nservices accessible on both television and personal computers (Wikipedia, 2022). The concept of VOD \nemerged in the media industry and is related to how video content is delivered. Video on Demand \n(VOD) is a technology that stores all content that can be accessed at any time that can be paused, \nplayback, skipped, or even downloaded (Pereira & Tam, 2021). \ne-ISSN: 2723-6692 \ud83d\udd6e p-ISSN: 2723-6595 \n \n \nIndonesian Journal of Social Science, Vol. 5, No. 4, April 2024 \n843 \nStreaming media has gained significant traction as a method for delivering Video on Demand \n(VOD). Platforms such as Apple's iTunes and Smart TV applications like Amazon Prime Video offer \noptions for renting or buying temporary video content. Additionally, there are Internet-based VOD \nsystems that provide access to bundles of entertainment content rather than just individual titles. \nAmong the most well-known VOD services are Netflix, Hulu, Disney+, Peacock, HBO Max, and \nParamount+, all of which operate on a subscription basis, requiring users to pay a monthly fee for \naccess to a library of movies, TV shows, and original series.  \n In contrast, platforms like YouTube and other internet-based Video on Demand (VOD) systems \nemploy an advertising-supported approach, offering most of their video content for free while \ncharging higher subscription fees for premium content access. Additionally, certain airlines offer VOD \nas part of their in-flight entertainment, providing passengers with access to content through in-seat \nvideo screens or external portable media players.. \nAs technology develops, a shift from conventional media to digital media has occurred. People \nspend more of their time online, including on social media. This opens up new opportunities for \nmarketers to reach their target market more interactively. Social media platforms like Facebook, \nTwitter, Instagram, and others have become very effective places to share information and content. \nContent that is unique, entertaining, or controversial has great potential to go viral. People tend to \nshare content that grabs their attention or triggers certain emotions. \nTherefore, the term viral marketing emerged. Viral marketing is a marketing strategy that aims \nto create buzz and generate widespread attention for a product, service, or brand through rapid and \nexponential content dissemination through word of mouth or online sharing. Viral marketing is one \nway of marketing based on the internet by taking advantage of opportunities where consumers often \nuse social networks in everyday life. \nAccording to Paramita, S. (2020, December). Viral Marketing Model Through Digital Content. In \nThe 2nd Tarumanagara International Conference on the Applications of Social Sciences and \nHumanities (TICASH 2020) (pp. 431-434). Atlantis Press. Viral marketing is basically a form of \ninternet-based word-of-mouth marketing (e-word of mouth marketing) whose promotional function \nis networking and designed like a virus spreading from one person to another quickly and widely by \nproviding special rewards to consumers.  \nThe trust of a consumer or customer in the company is needed, especially in a business that is \ncarried out with a viral marketing strategy that does not meet each other face to face in transactions. \nThe company must be able to make a consumer or customer put trust in the company through efforts \nto maintain and improve the quality of service to consumers or customers. \nHigh quality can offer added value by serving as a unique incentive for customers to cultivate \nenduring and mutually advantageous relationships with the company. (Tjiptono, 2022). This \nemotional connection enables the company to gain deep insights into the expectations and individual \nrequirements of customers, thereby enhancing customer satisfaction. By prioritizing a positive \ncustomer experience, companies can amplify enjoyable interactions while minimizing or eradicating \nnegative ones. Put simply, service quality can be seen as a gauge of how effectively the service level \nmeets customer expectations. (Tjiptono, 2022). \nBusiness activities began to shift from conventional patterns to more advanced patterns, one of \nwhich was shopping activities.  Shopping activities have begun to shift from offline shopping to online \nshopping. Online shopping is a business activity that uses information and communication technology \napplications in every transaction. Online shopping is not only used for buying and selling but also for \npromotional efforts at large.   Consumers do not need to come directly to the store, they only need to \nvisit the intended site and determine the goods / services they need.  \n The quality of service provided is also different when compared to the quality of service in \nconventional shopping models. In conventional shopping, service quality is measured directly \ne-ISSN: 2723-6692 \ud83d\udd6e p-ISSN: 2723-6595 \n \n \nIndonesian Journal of Social Science, Vol. 5, No. 4, April 2024 \n844 \nthrough activities between sellers and buyers, while the quality of online or electronic shopping is \nmeasured through services provided by companies through websites or what is often referred to as \ne-service quality. \n E-service quality refers to the quality of services provided through electronic channels such \nas websites, mobile applications, or online platforms. The focus is on the customer's perception of the \ntotal service experience when interacting online with the company or organization. E-service quality \nis important to build customer satisfaction, trust, and loyalty in the digital world. By focusing on the \nabove aspects, companies can deliver a seamless and satisfying online experience that meets or \nexceeds customer expectations.  \n E-service quality, commonly called E-SerQual, was developed to evaluate a service provided \non the internet network. Parasuraman et al. (2005) define e-service quality or electronic service \nquality as the extent to which a website is able to facilitate consumer activities, including shopping, \npurchasing, and delivery of both products and services efficiently and effectively.  Thus, customers \nwill be more efficient in making transactions in terms of time and cost. Similarly, the availability and \ncompleteness of information and ease of making transactions are also the customer's choice in using \nthe services of a company. \nOn the other hand, Walt Disney is a most influential and successful company with business \nmodels for animated and live-action films as well as television shows, theme parks and so on. The \nscope and volume of Walt Disney's influence was considerable in similar business environments.   \nDisney+ Hotstar is an Indian Video on Demand (VoD) service owned by Disney Star and launched in \n2015 which is a subsidiary of The Walt Disney Company.  Video on Demand (VoD) services such as \nDisney+ Hotstar are media delivery systems that allow users to access video without the restrictions \nof traditional video playback devices or typical static broadcast schedules.  Video on Demand (VoD) \nservice from Disney+ Hotstar can be used on several devices, such as Android-based Smart TVs, \nsmartphones, and tablets.  \nThe well-known survey institute Populix (2022) calls video-on-demand (VoD) services a \nconvenient way to watch a show, ranging from films to other visual series. This is because consumers \ndo not need to wait for the show schedule to start because consumers can choose their favorite \nprograms and watch them anytime and anywhere. In terms of consumer usage behavior, Populix \nstated that the majority of Indonesians (36 %) open and/or use Video on Demand (VoD) applications \nevery day, 13% of those surveyed open the application more than 5 times a week, 15 percent of \nrespondents open Video on Demand (VoD) applications 4-5 times a week, 25 percent of other \nrespondents use applications 2-3 times a week,  6 percent of users open an app once a week, only 4 \npercent of respondents use Video on Demand (VoD) services once a month, and only 1 percent of \nrespondents use Video on Demand (VoD) services once every two weeks. This number is quite \nextraordinary because it proves that Video on Demand (VoD) applications are increasingly popular \nand become the main choice of Indonesian people when looking for entertainment when tired. \nDatabooks (2023) states that Disney+ Hotstar is the best-selling paid streaming application in \nIndonesia. Its position even surpasses Netflix, Vidio, and HBO GO. Disney+ Hotstar is the best-selling \napp with 70% of respondents subscribing. Below Disney+ Hotstar is Netflix; the percentage of \nsubscribers surveyed is 46%, followed by Vidio at 41%.  \nBased on the above, the author tried to conduct a research entitled \"The Effect of Viral \nMarketing and E-Service Quality on Consumer Buying Interest in the Use of Disney+ Hotstar \nIndonesia Video On Demand (VoD) Services - Study on Disney+ Hotstar Indonesia Video On Demand \nService Users at the Faculty of Business and Economics UII Yogyakarta. \nThe purpose of this study is to determine the influence of Viral Marketing on consumer buying \ninterest in using Disney+Hotstar Indonesia's video-on-demand (VoD) service. \ne-ISSN: 2723-6692 \ud83d\udd6e p-ISSN: 2723-6595 \n \n \nIndonesian Journal of Social Science, Vol. 5, No. 4, April 2024 \n845 \nThis research is expected to increase knowledge and insight into the influence of viral \nmarketing and e-service quality on purchase intentions in the marketing field.

E-service quality \nis important to build customer satisfaction, trust, and loyalty in the digital world. By focusing on the \nabove aspects, companies can deliver a seamless and satisfying online experience that meets or \nexceeds customer expectations.  \n E-service quality, commonly called E-SerQual, was developed to evaluate a service provided \non the internet network. Parasuraman et al. (2005) define e-service quality or electronic service \nquality as the extent to which a website is able to facilitate consumer activities, including shopping, \npurchasing, and delivery of both products and services efficiently and effectively.  Thus, customers \nwill be more efficient in making transactions in terms of time and cost. Similarly, the availability and \ncompleteness of information and ease of making transactions are also the customer's choice in using \nthe services of a company. \nOn the other hand, Walt Disney is a most influential and successful company with business \nmodels for animated and live-action films as well as television shows, theme parks and so on. The \nscope and volume of Walt Disney's influence was considerable in similar business environments.   \nDisney+ Hotstar is an Indian Video on Demand (VoD) service owned by Disney Star and launched in \n2015 which is a subsidiary of The Walt Disney Company.  Video on Demand (VoD) services such as \nDisney+ Hotstar are media delivery systems that allow users to access video without the restrictions \nof traditional video playback devices or typical static broadcast schedules.  Video on Demand (VoD) \nservice from Disney+ Hotstar can be used on several devices, such as Android-based Smart TVs, \nsmartphones, and tablets.  \nThe well-known survey institute Populix (2022) calls video-on-demand (VoD) services a \nconvenient way to watch a show, ranging from films to other visual series.

            "introduction": "Video on Demand (VOD) is a",
            "methodology": "of delivering media content that enables viewers to watch \nvideos without being restricted by conventional playback devices or fixed broadcast schedules. \nDuring the 20th century, the dominant mode of media distribution was broadcasting via over-the-air \nprogramming. However, with the advent of internet technology and IPTV in the 1990s, there was a \ngrowing consumer demand for alternative ways to consume content, leading to the emergence of VOD \nservices accessible on both television and personal computers (Wikipedia, 2022). The concept of VOD \nemerged in the media industry and is related to how video content is delivered. Video on Demand \n(VOD) is a technology that stores all content that can be accessed at any time that can be paused, \nplayback, skipped, or even downloaded (Pereira & Tam, 2021). \ne-ISSN: 2723-6692 \ud83d\udd6e p-ISSN: 2723-6595 \n \n \nIndonesian Journal of Social Science, Vol. 5, No. 4, April 2024 \n843 \nStreaming media has gained significant traction as a method for delivering Video on Demand \n(VOD). Platforms such as Apple's iTunes and Smart TV applications like Amazon Prime Video offer \noptions for renting or buying temporary video content. Additionally, there are Internet-based VOD \nsystems that provide access to bundles of entertainment content rather than just individual titles. \nAmong the most well-known VOD services are Netflix, Hulu, Disney+, Peacock, HBO Max, and \nParamount+, all of which operate on a subscription basis, requiring users to pay a monthly fee for \naccess to a library of movies, TV shows, and original series.  \n In contrast, platforms like YouTube and other internet-based Video on Demand (VOD) systems \nemploy an advertising-supported approach, offering most of their video content for free while \ncharging higher subscription fees for premium content access. Additionally, certain airlines offer VOD \nas part of their in-flight entertainment, providing passengers with access to content through in-seat \nvideo screens or external portable media players.. \nAs technology develops, a shift from conventional media to digital media has occurred. People \nspend more of their time online, including on social media. This opens up new opportunities for \nmarketers to reach their target market more interactively. Social media platforms like Facebook, \nTwitter, Instagram, and others have become very effective places to share information and content. \nContent that is unique, entertaining, or controversial has great potential to go viral. People tend to \nshare content that grabs their attention or triggers certain emotions. \nTherefore, the term viral marketing emerged. Viral marketing is a marketing strategy that aims \nto create buzz and generate widespread attention for a product, service, or brand through rapid and \nexponential content dissemination through word of mouth or online sharing. Viral marketing is one \nway of marketing based on the internet by taking advantage of opportunities where consumers often \nuse social networks in everyday life. \nAccording to Paramita, S. (2020, December). Viral Marketing Model Through Digital Content. In \nThe 2nd Tarumanagara International Conference on the Applications of Social Sciences and \nHumanities (TICASH 2020) (pp. 431-434). Atlantis Press. Viral marketing is basically a form of \ninternet-based word-of-mouth marketing (e-word of mouth marketing) whose promotional function \nis networking and designed like a virus spreading from one person to another quickly and widely by \nproviding special rewards to consumers.  \nThe trust of a consumer or customer in the company is needed, especially in a business that is \ncarried out with a viral marketing strategy that does not meet each other face to face in transactions. \nThe company must be able to make a consumer or customer put trust in the company through efforts \nto maintain and improve the quality of service to consumers or customers. \nHigh quality can offer added value by serving as a unique incentive for customers to cultivate \nenduring and mutually advantageous relationships with the company. (Tjiptono, 2022). This \nemotional connection enables the company to gain deep insights into the expectations and individual \nrequirements of customers, thereby enhancing customer satisfaction. By prioritizing a positive \ncustomer experience, companies can amplify enjoyable interactions while minimizing or eradicating \nnegative ones. Put simply, service quality can be seen as a gauge of how effectively the service level \nmeets customer expectations. (Tjiptono, 2022). \nBusiness activities began to shift from conventional patterns to more advanced patterns, one of \nwhich was shopping activities.  Shopping activities have begun to shift from offline shopping to online \nshopping. Online shopping is a business activity that uses information and communication technology \napplications in every transaction. Online shopping is not only used for buying and selling but also for \npromotional efforts at large.   Consumers do not need to come directly to the store, they only need to \nvisit the intended site and determine the goods / services they need.  \n The quality of service provided is also different when compared to the quality of service in \nconventional shopping models. In conventional shopping, service quality is measured directly \ne-ISSN: 2723-6692 \ud83d\udd6e p-ISSN: 2723-6595 \n \n \nIndonesian Journal of Social Science, Vol. 5, No. 4, April 2024 \n844 \nthrough activities between sellers and buyers, while the quality of online or electronic shopping is \nmeasured through services provided by companies through websites or what is often referred to as \ne-service quality. \n E-service quality refers to the quality of services provided through electronic channels such \nas websites, mobile applications, or online platforms.

Social media platforms like Facebook, \nTwitter, Instagram, and others have become very effective places to share information and content. \nContent that is unique, entertaining, or controversial has great potential to go viral. People tend to \nshare content that grabs their attention or triggers certain emotions. \nTherefore, the term viral marketing emerged. Viral marketing is a marketing strategy that aims \nto create buzz and generate widespread attention for a product, service, or brand through rapid and \nexponential content dissemination through word of mouth or online sharing. Viral marketing is one \nway of marketing based on the internet by taking advantage of opportunities where consumers often \nuse social networks in everyday life. \nAccording to Paramita, S. (2020, December). Viral Marketing Model Through Digital Content. In \nThe 2nd Tarumanagara International Conference on the Applications of Social Sciences and \nHumanities (TICASH 2020) (pp. 431-434). Atlantis Press. Viral marketing is basically a form of \ninternet-based word-of-mouth marketing (e-word of mouth marketing) whose promotional function \nis networking and designed like a virus spreading from one person to another quickly and widely by \nproviding special rewards to consumers.  \nThe trust of a consumer or customer in the company is needed, especially in a business that is \ncarried out with a viral marketing strategy that does not meet each other face to face in transactions. \nThe company must be able to make a consumer or customer put trust in the company through efforts \nto maintain and improve the quality of service to consumers or customers. \nHigh quality can offer added value by serving as a unique incentive for customers to cultivate \nenduring and mutually advantageous relationships with the company. (Tjiptono, 2022). This \nemotional connection enables the company to gain deep insights into the expectations and individual \nrequirements of customers, thereby enhancing customer satisfaction. By prioritizing a positive \ncustomer experience, companies can amplify enjoyable interactions while minimizing or eradicating \nnegative ones. Put simply, service quality can be seen as a gauge of how effectively the service level \nmeets customer expectations. (Tjiptono, 2022). \nBusiness activities began to shift from conventional patterns to more advanced patterns, one of \nwhich was shopping activities.  Shopping activities have begun to shift from offline shopping to online \nshopping. Online shopping is a business activity that uses information and communication technology \napplications in every transaction. Online shopping is not only used for buying and selling but also for \npromotional efforts at large.   Consumers do not need to come directly to the store, they only need to \nvisit the intended site and determine the goods / services they need.  \n The quality of service provided is also different when compared to the quality of service in \nconventional shopping models. In conventional shopping, service quality is measured directly \ne-ISSN: 2723-6692 \ud83d\udd6e p-ISSN: 2723-6595 \n \n \nIndonesian Journal of Social Science, Vol. 5, No. 4, April 2024 \n844 \nthrough activities between sellers and buyers, while the quality of online or electronic shopping is \nmeasured through services provided by companies through websites or what is often referred to as \ne-service quality. \n E-service quality refers to the quality of services provided through electronic channels such \nas websites, mobile applications, or online platforms. The focus is on the customer's perception of the \ntotal service experience when interacting online with the company or organization. E-service quality \nis important to build customer satisfaction, trust, and loyalty in the digital world. By focusing on the \nabove aspects, companies can deliver a seamless and satisfying online experience that meets or \nexceeds customer expectations.  \n E-service quality, commonly called E-SerQual, was developed to evaluate a service provided \non the internet network. Parasuraman et al. (2005) define e-service quality or electronic service \nquality as the extent to which a website is able to facilitate consumer activities, including shopping, \npurchasing, and delivery of both products and services efficiently and effectively.  Thus, customers \nwill be more efficient in making transactions in terms of time and cost. Similarly, the availability and \ncompleteness of information and ease of making transactions are also the customer's choice in using \nthe services of a company. \nOn the other hand, Walt Disney is a most influential and successful company with business \nmodels for animated and live-action films as well as television shows, theme parks and so on. The \nscope and volume of Walt Disney's influence was considerable in similar business environments.   \nDisney+ Hotstar is an Indian Video on Demand (VoD) service owned by Disney Star and launched in \n2015 which is a subsidiary of The Walt Disney Company.  Video on Demand (VoD) services such as \nDisney+ Hotstar are media delivery systems that allow users to access video without the restrictions \nof traditional video playback devices or typical static broadcast schedules.  Video on Demand (VoD) \nservice from Disney+ Hotstar can be used on several devices, such as Android-based Smart TVs, \nsmartphones, and tablets.  \nThe well-known survey institute Populix (2022) calls video-on-demand (VoD) services a \nconvenient way to watch a show, ranging from films to other visual series. This is because consumers \ndo not need to wait for the show schedule to start because consumers can choose their favorite \nprograms and watch them anytime and anywhere. In terms of consumer usage behavior, Populix \nstated that the majority of Indonesians (36 %) open and/or use Video on Demand (VoD) applications \nevery day, 13% of those surveyed open the application more than 5 times a week, 15 percent of \nrespondents open Video on Demand (VoD) applications 4-5 times a week, 25 percent of other \nrespondents use applications 2-3 times a week,  6 percent of users open an app once a week, only 4 \npercent of respondents use Video on Demand (VoD) services once a month, and only 1 percent of \nrespondents use Video on Demand (VoD) services once every two weeks. This number is quite \nextraordinary because it proves that Video on Demand (VoD) applications are increasingly popular \nand become the main choice of Indonesian people when looking for entertainment when tired. \nDatabooks (2023) states that Disney+ Hotstar is the best-selling paid streaming application in \nIndonesia. Its position even surpasses Netflix, Vidio, and HBO GO. Disney+ Hotstar is the best-selling \napp with 70% of respondents subscribing. Below Disney+ Hotstar is Netflix; the percentage of \nsubscribers surveyed is 46%, followed by Vidio at 41%.  \nBased on the above, the author tried to conduct a research entitled \"The Effect of Viral \nMarketing and E-Service Quality on Consumer Buying Interest in the Use of Disney+ Hotstar \nIndonesia Video On Demand (VoD) Services - Study on Disney+ Hotstar Indonesia Video On Demand \nService Users at the Faculty of Business and Economics UII Yogyakarta. \nThe purpose of this study is to determine the influence of Viral Marketing on consumer buying \ninterest in using Disney+Hotstar Indonesia's video-on-demand (VoD) service. \ne-ISSN: 2723-6692 \ud83d\udd6e p-ISSN: 2723-6595 \n \n \nIndonesian Journal of Social Science, Vol. 5, No. 4, April 2024 \n845 \nThis research is expected to increase knowledge and insight into the influence of viral \nmarketing and e-service quality on purchase intentions in the marketing field.

It \nalso illustrates the importance of activities related to Viral Marketing and E-Service Quality for \nDisney+Hotstar Indonesia companies so that Consumer Buying Interest is always well \nmaintained. \ne-ISSN: 2723-6692 \ud83d\udd6e p-ISSN: 2723-6595 \n \n \nIndonesian Journal of Social Science, Vol. 5, No. 4, April 2024 \n857 \n2. \nIf the Viral Marketing variable (X1) increases by 1% and the E-Service Quality variable (X2) is \nzero. The constant is also zero, then the Viral Marketing variable (X1) will contribute positively \nby 0.267 units to the Consumer Buying Interest variable of Disney+Hotstar Indonesia users.   \nThis is in line with research conducted by Furqon (2020), which shows that Viral Marketing has \na significant effect on purchasing decisions. In addition, research conducted by Sembiring & \nAnanda (2019) and research conducted by Dima et al. (2020) also show that there is a significant \nimpact of viral marketing on consumer purchase intentions.   \nIn theory, this is in line with what Hendrayati & Pamungkas (2020) conveyed, which states that Viral \nMarketing is something that has been created by the company itself to promote its products, in \nthe hope that people who see the campaign will be impressed so that they will convey the \nmessage to their friends and family. \n3. \nFurthermore, if the E-Service Quality (X2) variable increases by 1% and Viral Marketing (X1) is \nzero and the constant is also zero, then the E-Service Quality (X2) variable will contribute \npositively by 0.423 units to the Consumer Buying Interest variable of Disney+Hotstar Indonesia \nusers.   \nIf you look at the results of multiple regression tests simultaneously where it turns out that the \nViral Marketing Variable (VM_X1) and the E-Service Quality Variable (ESQ_X2) simultaneously or \ntogether have a positive and significant effect on the Consumer Buying Interest Variable (MBK_Y) \nwith a coefficient of determination of 0.404, it means the ability of the independent or \nindependent variable to explain the dependent variable is 40.4%.  Thus, there are still about \n59.6%, which is another factor that affects the dependent variable. \nThus, the Disney+Hotstar Indonesia company still needs to find other factors that influence \nconsumer purchase intentions on Disney+Hotstar Indonesia products so that the company has higher \ncompetitiveness.  Other factors beyond Viral Marketing and E-Service Quality which amounted to \n59.6% are a challenge for future researchers to conduct further research. \n \n \n4. Conclusion \nBased on the analysis and discussion of the influence of Viral Marketing and E-Service Quality \non Consumer Buying Interest in using Disney+Hotstar Indonesia's video-on-demand (VoD) service, \nseveral conclusions emerge. Firstly, it is evident that Viral Marketing significantly impacts Consumer \nBuying Interest in utilizing Disney+Hotstar Indonesia's VoD service. Secondly, E-Service Quality also \nplays a crucial role in influencing Consumer Buying Interest in the same service. Moreover, when \nconsidering both Viral Marketing and E-Service Quality together, they jointly exert a considerable \ninfluence on Consumer Buying Interest in utilizing Disney+Hotstar Indonesia's VoD services. These \nfindings underscore the importance of effective marketing strategies and high-quality service \nprovision in driving consumer interest and engagement with VoD platforms like Disney+Hotstar \nIndonesia. \n \n5.

Viral marketing is basically a form of \ninternet-based word-of-mouth marketing (e-word of mouth marketing) whose promotional function \nis networking and designed like a virus spreading from one person to another quickly and widely by \nproviding special rewards to consumers.  \nThe trust of a consumer or customer in the company is needed, especially in a business that is \ncarried out with a viral marketing strategy that does not meet each other face to face in transactions. \nThe company must be able to make a consumer or customer put trust in the company through efforts \nto maintain and improve the quality of service to consumers or customers. \nHigh quality can offer added value by serving as a unique incentive for customers to cultivate \nenduring and mutually advantageous relationships with the company. (Tjiptono, 2022). This \nemotional connection enables the company to gain deep insights into the expectations and individual \nrequirements of customers, thereby enhancing customer satisfaction. By prioritizing a positive \ncustomer experience, companies can amplify enjoyable interactions while minimizing or eradicating \nnegative ones. Put simply, service quality can be seen as a gauge of how effectively the service level \nmeets customer expectations. (Tjiptono, 2022). \nBusiness activities began to shift from conventional patterns to more advanced patterns, one of \nwhich was shopping activities.  Shopping activities have begun to shift from offline shopping to online \nshopping. Online shopping is a business activity that uses information and communication technology \napplications in every transaction. Online shopping is not only used for buying and selling but also for \npromotional efforts at large.   Consumers do not need to come directly to the store, they only need to \nvisit the intended site and determine the goods / services they need.  \n The quality of service provided is also different when compared to the quality of service in \nconventional shopping models. In conventional shopping, service quality is measured directly \ne-ISSN: 2723-6692 \ud83d\udd6e p-ISSN: 2723-6595 \n \n \nIndonesian Journal of Social Science, Vol. 5, No. 4, April 2024 \n844 \nthrough activities between sellers and buyers, while the quality of online or electronic shopping is \nmeasured through services provided by companies through websites or what is often referred to as \ne-service quality. \n E-service quality refers to the quality of services provided through electronic channels such \nas websites, mobile applications, or online platforms. The focus is on the customer's perception of the \ntotal service experience when interacting online with the company or organization. E-service quality \nis important to build customer satisfaction, trust, and loyalty in the digital world. By focusing on the \nabove aspects, companies can deliver a seamless and satisfying online experience that meets or \nexceeds customer expectations.  \n E-service quality, commonly called E-SerQual, was developed to evaluate a service provided \non the internet network. Parasuraman et al. (2005) define e-service quality or electronic service \nquality as the extent to which a website is able to facilitate consumer activities, including shopping, \npurchasing, and delivery of both products and services efficiently and effectively.  Thus, customers \nwill be more efficient in making transactions in terms of time and cost. Similarly, the availability and \ncompleteness of information and ease of making transactions are also the customer's choice in using \nthe services of a company. \nOn the other hand, Walt Disney is a most influential and successful company with business \nmodels for animated and live-action films as well as television shows, theme parks and so on. The \nscope and volume of Walt Disney's influence was considerable in similar business environments.   \nDisney+ Hotstar is an Indian Video on Demand (VoD) service owned by Disney Star and launched in \n2015 which is a subsidiary of The Walt Disney Company.  Video on Demand (VoD) services such as \nDisney+ Hotstar are media delivery systems that allow users to access video without the restrictions \nof traditional video playback devices or typical static broadcast schedules.  Video on Demand (VoD) \nservice from Disney+ Hotstar can be used on several devices, such as Android-based Smart TVs, \nsmartphones, and tablets.  \nThe well-known survey institute Populix (2022) calls video-on-demand (VoD) services a \nconvenient way to watch a show, ranging from films to other visual series. This is because consumers \ndo not need to wait for the show schedule to start because consumers can choose their favorite \nprograms and watch them anytime and anywhere. In terms of consumer usage behavior, Populix \nstated that the majority of Indonesians (36 %) open and/or use Video on Demand (VoD) applications \nevery day, 13% of those surveyed open the application more than 5 times a week, 15 percent of \nrespondents open Video on Demand (VoD) applications 4-5 times a week, 25 percent of other \nrespondents use applications 2-3 times a week,  6 percent of users open an app once a week, only 4 \npercent of respondents use Video on Demand (VoD) services once a month, and only 1 percent of \nrespondents use Video on Demand (VoD) services once every two weeks. This number is quite \nextraordinary because it proves that Video on Demand (VoD) applications are increasingly popular \nand become the main choice of Indonesian people when looking for entertainment when tired. \nDatabooks (2023) states that Disney+ Hotstar is the best-selling paid streaming application in \nIndonesia. Its position even surpasses Netflix, Vidio, and HBO GO. Disney+ Hotstar is the best-selling \napp with 70% of respondents subscribing. Below Disney+ Hotstar is Netflix; the percentage of \nsubscribers surveyed is 46%, followed by Vidio at 41%.  \nBased on the above, the author tried to conduct a research entitled \"The Effect of Viral \nMarketing and E-Service Quality on Consumer Buying Interest in the Use of Disney+ Hotstar \nIndonesia Video On Demand (VoD) Services - Study on Disney+ Hotstar Indonesia Video On Demand \nService Users at the Faculty of Business and Economics UII Yogyakarta. \nThe purpose of this study is to determine the influence of Viral Marketing on consumer buying \ninterest in using Disney+Hotstar Indonesia's video-on-demand (VoD) service. \ne-ISSN: 2723-6692 \ud83d\udd6e p-ISSN: 2723-6595 \n \n \nIndonesian Journal of Social Science, Vol. 5, No. 4, April 2024 \n845 \nThis research is expected to increase knowledge and insight into the influence of viral \nmarketing and e-service quality on purchase intentions in the marketing field.

In the column  Adjusted R Square, There is a number of 0.404, which means \nthat the coefficient of determination is 40.4%. The figure 40.4% means that the ability of the \nindependent variable or independent to explain a bound variable or Dependent is 40.4%.  Thus, there \nare still about 59.6% which is another factor that affects the dependent variable or Dependent. \n \nDiscussion of Results \nIf the regression equation is consulted with the results of research data processing as \nmentioned in the table below: \nTable 19 Regression Equation Results \nCoefficientsa \nType \nUnstandardized \nCoefficients \nStandard\nized \nCoefficie\nnts \nt \nSig. \nCollinearity \nStatistics \nB \nStd. \nError \nBeta \nToleranc\ne \nVIF \n1 \n(Constant) \n-.827 \n3.288 \n \n-.251 \n.802 \n \n \nVM_X1 \n.267 \n.077 \n.280 \n3.485 \n.001 \n.517 \n1.934 \nESQ_X2 \n.423 \n.082 \n.414 \n5.166 \n.000 \n.517 \n1.934 \na. Dependent Variable: MBK_Y \nSource: Researcher's Processed Data. 2023 \nThen the regression equation becomes: \nY = -0.827 + 0.267X1 + 0.423X2 + e \nThe regression equation means that: \n1. \nIf there is no change in the Viral Marketing variable  (X1) and E-Service Quality variable (X2), \nthere will be -0.827 units in Consumer Purchase Intent for Disney+Hotstar Indonesia users.  It \nalso illustrates the importance of activities related to Viral Marketing and E-Service Quality for \nDisney+Hotstar Indonesia companies so that Consumer Buying Interest is always well \nmaintained. \ne-ISSN: 2723-6692 \ud83d\udd6e p-ISSN: 2723-6595 \n \n \nIndonesian Journal of Social Science, Vol. 5, No. 4, April 2024 \n857 \n2. \nIf the Viral Marketing variable (X1) increases by 1% and the E-Service Quality variable (X2) is \nzero. The constant is also zero, then the Viral Marketing variable (X1) will contribute positively \nby 0.267 units to the Consumer Buying Interest variable of Disney+Hotstar Indonesia users.   \nThis is in line with research conducted by Furqon (2020), which shows that Viral Marketing has \na significant effect on purchasing decisions. In addition, research conducted by Sembiring & \nAnanda (2019) and research conducted by Dima et al. (2020) also show that there is a significant \nimpact of viral marketing on consumer purchase intentions.   \nIn theory, this is in line with what Hendrayati & Pamungkas (2020) conveyed, which states that Viral \nMarketing is something that has been created by the company itself to promote its products, in \nthe hope that people who see the campaign will be impressed so that they will convey the \nmessage to their friends and family. \n3. \nFurthermore, if the E-Service Quality (X2) variable increases by 1% and Viral Marketing (X1) is \nzero and the constant is also zero, then the E-Service Quality (X2) variable will contribute \npositively by 0.423 units to the Consumer Buying Interest variable of Disney+Hotstar Indonesia \nusers.   \nIf you look at the results of multiple regression tests simultaneously where it turns out that the \nViral Marketing Variable (VM_X1) and the E-Service Quality Variable (ESQ_X2) simultaneously or \ntogether have a positive and significant effect on the Consumer Buying Interest Variable (MBK_Y) \nwith a coefficient of determination of 0.404, it means the ability of the independent or \nindependent variable to explain the dependent variable is 40.4%.  Thus, there are still about \n59.6%, which is another factor that affects the dependent variable. \nThus, the Disney+Hotstar Indonesia company still needs to find other factors that influence \nconsumer purchase intentions on Disney+Hotstar Indonesia products so that the company has higher \ncompetitiveness.  Other factors beyond Viral Marketing and E-Service Quality which amounted to \n59.6% are a challenge for future researchers to conduct further research. \n \n \n4. Conclusion \nBased on the analysis and discussion of the influence of Viral Marketing and E-Service Quality \non Consumer Buying Interest in using Disney+Hotstar Indonesia's video-on-demand (VoD) service, \nseveral conclusions emerge. Firstly, it is evident that Viral Marketing significantly impacts Consumer \nBuying Interest in utilizing Disney+Hotstar Indonesia's VoD service. Secondly, E-Service Quality also \nplays a crucial role in influencing Consumer Buying Interest in the same service. Moreover, when \nconsidering both Viral Marketing and E-Service Quality together, they jointly exert a considerable \ninfluence on Consumer Buying Interest in utilizing Disney+Hotstar Indonesia's VoD services. These \nfindings underscore the importance of effective marketing strategies and high-quality service \nprovision in driving consumer interest and engagement with VoD platforms like Disney+Hotstar \nIndonesia. \n \n5.

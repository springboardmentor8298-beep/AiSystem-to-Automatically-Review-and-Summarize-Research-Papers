Haider\n1,2\u2709& Reem Shuhaiber1\nRecently, subtitles in different languages have become more available and accessible, thanks\nto streaming platforms like Net\ufb02ix, which provide viewers with multiple language choices,\nincluding Arabic and English. This study examines the strategies of subtitling Egyptian\nphraseological units, particularly idioms, into English. The parallel corpus of data under\nexamination consists of two Egyptian movies, namely, \u201c\nThe Great Chinese\nBeans\u201d and \u201c\nThe Humans and the Mongoose\u201d. Following Baker\u2019s taxonomy of\ntranslation strategies, the analysis showed that the examined idioms were predominantly\ntranslated through cultural substitution. The analysis also showed that there were instances\nof erroneous literal translation. Furthermore, several cases of mistranslation were identi\ufb01ed,\nwhich could be attributed to a potential lack of understanding of the nuances and subtleties of\nthe source and target cultures, as well as limitations and dif\ufb01culties in \ufb01nding appropriate\nequivalents.

Among these ever-expanding branches is audiovisual\ntranslation (AVT). AVT, as de\ufb01ned by Gonz\u00e1lez (2009) is a\nbranch of translation that handles the cross-linguistic and cross-\ncultural transfer of multimedia and multimodal texts.\nThe growth of this \ufb01eld corresponded with that of the \ufb01lm\nindustry (Perego & Pacinotti, 2020), which has \ufb02ourished espe-\ncially in English-speaking countries and to different extents\nglobally. This has led to a unique form and signi\ufb01cant degree of\ncultural exchange that was only possible through AVT (Alabbasi,\n2009).\nThis phenomenon was expanded by the popularization of\nonline platforms as they have a global reach. To optimize this\nreach, streaming platforms provide various audio and subtitling\noptions to make their content accessible to a larger audience\n(D\u00edaz-Cintas & Massidda, 2019). This means that audiences may\nwatch and enjoy media even if they do not understand the lan-\nguage in which it was created. For instance, English speakers may\nwatch movies produced in Arabic and comprehend the speech\nthrough the provided subtitles (Haider et al., 2023; Samha et al.,\n2023). However, subtitling may be complicated if the language at\nhand is challenging or bound to a culture (Williams, 1990).\nLanguages may be seen as a microcosm of culture as its con-\ntainers and carriers. Each language and its culture intertwine in\ndistinctive ways that are incongruent with other languages and\ncultures. This makes the translation of some items challenging,\nwhich may result in a loss of meaning. Thus, translators resort to\nvarious strategies to convey the sense of the source text with the\nleast loss (Farghal, 2020). Most phraseological units, like idio-\nmatic expressions, contain connotative and implicit meanings\nthat are understood through their cultural meaning instead of\ntheir denotative meaning (Xalilova & Atoyeva, 2023). Therefore,\ntheir rendition requires that the translator has a grasp of the\nsource culture as well as the target cultures (Farghal & Haider,\n2023).\nWhile several studies have focused on the Arabic subtitling of\nEnglish media (Abu-Rayyash et al., 2023; Al-Yasin & Rabab\u2019ah,\n2019; Al-Zgoul & Al-Salman, 2022; Debbas & Haider, 2020), few\nhave examined how Arabic media is subtitled into English\n(Haider et al., 2023; Samha et al., 2023). Egypt has a thriving\ncinematic culture that is popular not only in the country but also\nin the surrounding region. English subtitles can allow non-Arabic\nspeakers to appreciate these works as well. Nonetheless, Egyptian\nspeech, in reality, and in their cinematic works, is \ufb01lled with\nphraseological units, such as idiomatic expressions, which\nnecessitate additional attention in translation. Hence, this paper\nexamines two movies that contain such expressions and analyses\nthe challenges posed to subtitlers by idiomatic expressions and\nthe strategies used in their rendition.\nThe study at hand attempts to answer the following two\nquestions:\n\u25cf\nWhat are the challenges that face subtitlers when rendering\nEgyptian idioms into English in \u2018Great Beans of China\u2019 and\n\u2018The Humans and the Mongoose\u2019 Movies?\n\u25cf\nWhich strategies are employed in the English subtitling of\nEgyptian idiomatic expressions in the two investigated\nmovies?\nLiterature review\nThis section relates the current study to previous research\nincluding both a theoretical and empirical background. Transla-\ntion has achieved a status of relevance, which Bassnett (2013)\nrelates to the rise of the availability and the use of electronics.\nFurthermore, she describes translation as a human condition that\nincreases cross-cultural communication. A branch of translation\nthat is closely related to the advancement of technology is\naudiovisual translation (D\u00edaz-Cintas, 2005), which may also be\ncalled multimedia translation. Moreover, P\u00e9rez-Gonz\u00e1lez (2014)\nfound that this is the fastest-growing area of translation studies as\nwell. Chiaro (2012, p. 30) de\ufb01ned AVT as the rendition of the\nsource language verbal contents of audiovisual media in the target\nlanguage. Furthermore, audiovisual translation contains various\nmodes of subtitling and revoicing, such as inter and intralingual\nsubtitling, dubbing, voiceover, and audio description.\nSubtitling. Subtitling is among the many branches of AVT, and it\nis among the most prominent. Subtitling, which is the focus of\nthis paper, involves providing written captions often transposed\nlow on the screen, that re\ufb02ect the dialogue and other aural codes.\nThus, the subtitlers work from the spoken and aural codes into a\nwritten form, changing the mode in which the information is\npresented. According to De Linde and Kay (2016), subtitles may\nbe intralingual, where the written code and spoken code are of the\nsame language, or interlingual, where the written code is in a\ndifferent language than the spoken code. Subtitles may also be\ncategorized into open or closed captions based on the viewer\u2019s\ncapability of turning the captions on and off.\nD\u00edaz-Cintas (2005) found that subtitling contains many\nadvantages as it is both time and cost-effective and may be\napplied to many forms of audiovisual media. However, subtitling\nis governed by two main technical factors, which are spatial and\ntemporal constraints and must also abide by synchrony with the\nsource product. Therefore, subtitling, or on-screen translation,\ntypically does not exceed two lines at the bottom of the screen.\nThese properties in\ufb02uence the subtitler\u2019s renditions, choices, and\nthe translation strategies they employ.\nOn this basis, Diaz-Cintas and Remael (2014) asserted that\nsubtitling requires that three skills be performed: spotting,\nrendering, and adaptation. Furthermore, they highlighted some\nstrategies such as translation and calque, which follow ST forms,\ncompensation, explicitation, and substitution that cover cultural\nand linguistic gaps, lexical recreation where new terms are\ninvented, transposition which linguistically modi\ufb01es the text, and\nomission and addition which modify the amount of information\nin the text. All of these strategies are useful for subtitlers.\nChallenges of translating idiomatic expressions. As discussed\nabove, the mode of translation in\ufb02uences the process and product\nof translation. While this in\ufb02uence is signi\ufb01cant, there are other\nplayers that may affect translation. This includes not only the\ncontent of the source text but its form as well. For instance,\ntranslating idiomatic expressions poses linguistic, cultural, and\npragmatic challenges. As Shanti Manipuspika and Reska Julia\nWinzami (2021) stated that idiomatic translation entails much\nmore than just switching out lexical and grammatical compo-\nnents between the two languages; it can even involve eliminating\nsome of the text\u2019s fundamental linguistic components. Linguis-\ntically, idiomatic expressions often contain elements that cannot\nbe translated due to lexical differences. Likewise, Li et al. (2024)\nAsserted that the translation of idioms becomes challenging due\nto their non-literariness, which requires that they are contextually\nanalyzed to interpret their true sense. Otherwise, mistranslation\nbecomes a signi\ufb01cant probability. Culturally, Ajaaj and Moham-\nmed (2014) argued that human languages have deeply ingrained\ncultural idiomaticity, which varies from language to language.\nFurthermore, idiomatic expressions are deeply embedded in the\nARTICLE\nHUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-024-03327-4\n2\nHUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS |  (2024) 11:949 | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-024-03327-4\nsource culture\u2019s context, requiring the subtitlers to \ufb01nd equivalent\nexpressions in the target culture. Moreover, pragmatically, such\nexpressions must be translated in a way that maintains the ori-\nginal tone and intent within the subtitles\u2019 concise format. Salman\n(2015) also argued for the pragmatic translation of idioms. This\napproach requires cultural and linguistic awareness to convey the\nintended meaning of the expression. This can be achieved\nthrough a number of strategies, but paraphrasing is among the\nmost frequently employed.\nTranslating idiomatic expressions. Idioms and proverbs fall\nunder the umbrella of phraseological units; therefore, their use\nand translation are linked with phraseology. Phraseology is a\nstudy that examines word and phrase usage in relation to context\nand language. Particularly, phraseology is interested in \ufb01xed and\nsemi-\ufb01xed expressions such as idioms, proverbs, and collocations.\nSuch expressions are characterized by the difference between their\nmeaning and the individual meanings of their wordings. This gap\nmakes the deduction of the sense of the whole impossible based\non the sum of its parts (Mel\u2019cuk, 1995).\nPhraseology is interconnected with the disciplines of linguis-\ntics, lexicography, translation, and language and its studies\n(Paquot, 2015). Additionally, Fedulenkova (2019) found that\nphraseological units serve many pragmatic functions, including\nbasic, normative, and occasional functions, such as cumulative,\nstylistic, directive, summarizing, and evaluative functions, which\ninteract with discourse.\nThe study of parems, such as proverbs and idioms, is known as\nparemiology. This includes the study of their origins and history,\nand\nexamining\nhow\nthey\nare\nemployed\nand\ninterpreted.\nParemiology is described as a branch of phraseology to both\nlinguistics and culture. Similarly, Dabbagh (2017) suggested that\nparemiology should be studied through cultural frameworks and\ncultural conceptualizations, which are cultural metaphor, schema,\nand category. Paremiology enhances communication abilities by\nidentifying and explaining patterns of language use. Speci\ufb01cally, it\nrelates proverbs with their cultural and historical use as well as\ntheir in\ufb02uence on communication and social interactions.\nIdiomatic expressions and proverbs are used by all peoples as\nan essential part of their culture (Akbari, 2013). Furthermore,\nNida (1964) stated that their meaning is interlinked with both the\nculture and context from which they emerged in\ufb02uenced and\nincorporated by the cultural context in which they were\ndeveloped. The intrinsic relationship between such expressions\nand culture may complicate their transfer through translation (Ali\n& Al-Rushaidi, 2017). Moreover, Ordudari (2007) argued that the\nconnotative meaning of an idiom or allusion in the source\nlanguage and culture is not necessarily the same in the target\nlanguage. Similarly, Al-Khawaldeh et al. (2016) found that the\ncomplexity of working with idioms from another culture begins\nwith understanding them. Therefore, it is necessary for translators\nto have cultural competence in both the source and target\nlanguage and possess the necessary skills to apply the necessary\ntranslation strategies adequately.\nSince some cultural and linguistic nuances remove the\npossibility of a direct accurate translation, some elements may\nbe paraphrased in subtitling. This requires the subtitlers to\npossess linguistic and cultural competence. This enables them to\nconsider the linguistic and cultural distinctions of the source and\ntarget languages to transfer the intended sense of the source text.\nThe subtitles must also be accurate, succinct, and viewer-friendly\ncondensed material.\nThe translation of idioms has thus proven to be a complex act\nin general contexts. However, subtitling places further barriers on\nthis act due to the constraining nature of this branch of\ntranslation. Hence, Romero-Fresco (2009) found that a distin-\nguishing feature of subtitling is condensation. This is due to the\n\ufb01nite time and space allocated for the subtitles. In addition, there\nis a need to consider viewers\u2019 reading speeds, which are lessened\ndue to their split attention between the media and the subtitles.\nHence, Baker (1992, pp. 71\u201378) suggested strategies that can be\nemployed to overcome the challenging nature of idiom transla-\ntion which are quoted as:\n\u25cf\nUsing an idiom of similar meaning and form to the source\nlanguage.\n\u25cf\nUsing an idiom of similar meaning but a different form.\n\u25cf\nTranslation by using paraphrasing is the most common\nway of translating idioms.\n\u25cf\nTranslation by omission is to omit the whole idiom and not\nbe translated into the TL text.\nSimilarly, Baker (1992, pp. 26\u201342) indicated that translation\nchallenges must be connected to translation strategies under a\nsystemic approach. Furthermore, Baker suggested the following\nstrategies as a basis for translation practice and training.\n\u25cf\nTranslation by more general words (superordinate)\n\u25cf\nTranslation by more neutral/ less expressive words\n\u25cf\nTranslation by cultural substitution\n\u25cf\nTranslation by using a loan word or loan word plus an\nexplanation\n\u25cf\nTranslation by paraphrasing using a related word\n\u25cf\nTranslation by paraphrasing using unrelated words\n\u25cf\nTranslation by omission\n\u25cf\nTranslation by illustration\nThis study relies on these strategies as a basis for its qualitative\nanalysis when examining the subtitling of idioms.\nEmpirical studies. Translating idiomatic expressions has attrac-\nted the attention of several researchers. Various studies focused\non the effects of language and culture in this \ufb01eld. For instance,\nAl-Shawi and Mahadi (2012) carried out a study investigating the\nproblem of translating idioms from Arabic into English language\nand vice versa in social and religious cultures. The corpus was\nmostly gathered from two sources. The \ufb01rst source consisted of\nlive content such as TV, radio, movies, and everyday interactions.\nWritten materials like dictionaries, novels, magazines, and\nnewspapers made up the second source. The study revealed that a\ntranslator\u2019s familiarity with a particular culture can often be used\nto identify the meaning of an idiom, especially when it has a\nnonliteral meaning. It was discovered that translating such idioms\ncan be accomplished through the use of \ufb01ve strategies, namely,\nparaphrasing the idiom, using similar meanings but dissimilar\nforms, using notes, looking up an informant, and employing a\nparallel idiom in the target language.\nIdioms are prominent in many genres and different forms of\nmedia. For example, Farghal and Al-Hamly (2015) examined the\nsigni\ufb01cance of the use of proverbs in Arabic literature from a\npragmatic and semiotic value with a focus on the discourse of\ntheir translation. The results concluded that omission was the\nmost prominent strategy, followed by literal translation and then\nfunctional translation. Likewise, Al-assaf (2019) followed Baker\u2019s\nstrategies to examine The Arabic translation of the idioms found\nin Agatha Christie novel. The results indicated a high tendency\nfor the employment of paraphrasing but also highlighted the\nunavailability of equivalent Arabic idioms.\nIn addition, Abu-Ssaydeh (2004) examined strategies used by\nArab translators to translate English idioms into Arabic. The\nstudy examined a corpus of over two hundred idioms extracted\nfrom the Arabic version of Newsweek, which were placed under\nHUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-024-03327-4\nARTICLE\nHUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS |  (2024) 11:949 | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-024-03327-4\n3\nsix categories based on translation strategy. The idioms were\ncategorized into six main categories according to the strategy\nadopted in their translation. The \ufb01ndings revealed that the most\nfrequently utilized strategy is paraphrasing, followed by literal\ntranslation and semantic equivalence, with compensation and\nomission. It was also revealed that some English idioms have been\nintegrated into Arabic vocabulary due to literal translation.\nFinally, it was found that a large number of the translations were\ndetermined to be literal, making them sound \u201cforeign\u201d or\nmeaningless to the Arab reader.\nIn the \ufb01eld of AVT, Zitawi (2003) conducted a study on the\nArabic dubbing of English children\u2019s cartoons examining the\nstrategies employed in the rendition of idioms. The results\nshowed that dynamic, literal, and naturalized translations were\nemployed in the dubbing alongside the strategies of deletion and\naddition.\nFurthermore, Dweik and Suleiman (2013) examined the\ndif\ufb01culties faced by Jordanian English Majors while translating\nculturally bound expressions. The study\u2019s sample consisted of\nsixty graduate students enrolled in three Jordanian universities\u2019\nM.A. programs. The study showed that the students were\nchallenged by unfamiliarity and ambiguity, and found it dif\ufb01cult\nto provide cultural equivalents. Additionally, their unawareness of\ntranslation strategies further complicated the task.\nSimilarly, through a test and set of interviews Thalji and Dweik\n(2015) found that inexperienced Jordanian translators struggle to\nprovide adequate renditions of idioms. Mistranslations were\nrelated to a literal approach that included linguistic and stylistic\nerrors.\nLikewise, Al Mubarak (2017) investigated challenges encoun-\ntered while translating Arabic idioms into English by examining\nthe works of Sudanese English students. The researcher employed\na descriptive methodology to pinpoint and enumerate the issues\nstudents had when attempting to translate Arabic idioms into\nEnglish using speci\ufb01c strategies. The tool that was utilized for\ngathering the data was a translation test. The test was comprised\nof twelve Arabic proverbs according to Speake\u2019s (2008) taxonomy\nof proverbs. The study\u2019s \ufb01ndings revealed that the student\u2019s\nability to translate Arabic idioms into English is somewhat\nconstricted, and it was found that the range of strategies they\nadopted is a re\ufb02ection of the differences in their linguistic and\npragmatic competence, as well as the degree of their familiarity\nwith these idioms. It was also revealed that the students struggled\nto \ufb01nd the appropriate equivalent term in English, as seen by\ntheir inability to translate idiomatic expressions using the proper\nor appropriate equivalent. Finally, it was concluded that certain\nchallenges with the translation strategy found while translating\nArabic idioms to English are due to students\u2019 lack of strategy\nknowledge.\nResearch in this area also focused on the cultural aspects of\nidioms and their translations. Fahmi (2016) detailed sociocultural\nvariations by comparing similar thematically categorized idioms\nacross English and Arabic. The \ufb01ndings indicated a necessity for\nfamiliarity with SL and TL cultures as well as traditions and\ncultures.\nMoreover, the translations of proverbs must be carried out\nsystematically and not be rendered literally, keeping in mind the\nproverbs\u2019 cultural, religious, and historical context to maintain\nthe essence of meaning. Likewise, Ali and Al-Rushaidi (2017)\ninvestigated the dif\ufb01culties faced by sixty Omani undergraduate\nstudents studying English language teaching and literature when\ntranslating idiomatic expressions into Arabic. The \ufb01ndings\nshowed that the students could not \ufb01nd an appropriate\nequivalent, misunderstood the idiom\u2019s meaning, used literal\ntranslation, and deleted the entire or some parts of the idiom\nwithout compensation.\nJibreel (2023) highlighted the complexity of translating idioms\nby examining machine translations of idioms in an English-\nArabic language pair. The results indicated that machine\ntranslation mostly employs a literal rather than communicative\napproach. Thus, mistranslations may emerge from a failure to\ninterpret the sense of the idiom or a failure to portray it through\nadequate phrasing.\nShhaiber and Haider (2023) examined the translation of idioms\nin the English Net\ufb02ix subtitles of four Egyptian \ufb01lms. The results\nshowed that paraphrasing was a common strategy. However, the\nuse of literal translation was also found which resulted in shifts in\nmeaning. Furthermore, mistranslation, which was linked to\ncultural incompetency, also led to meaning shifts. Additionally,\nthere was an issue of consistency in the translations of repeated\nphrases.\nMoreover, Destaria and Rini (2019) followed a descriptive\nqualitative approach in applying Baker\u2019s taxonomy to assess the\neffectiveness of translation strategies in the Indonesian subtitles of\nidiomatic expressions in the \ufb01lm Pitch Perfect 3. The results\nshowed that the majority of the idioms were rendered accurately\nand a number of strategies were used. Paraphrasing represented\nthe most common strategy while using a similar idiom and\nomission were rare.\nShanti Manipuspika and Reska Julia Winzami (2021) examined\nhow English idioms were translated into Indonesian in the\nsubtitles of the \ufb01lm Murder on the Orient Express. The results\nindicated that paraphrasing was the dominant strategy as it\nclari\ufb01es the sense of the text with consideration of cultural\ndifferences. Substitution with an idiom of similar meaning but a\ndifferent form was also common for similar reasons. On the other\nhand, translation with an idiom of similar meaning and form and\nomission were less common.\nAulia Sa\ufb01tri et al. (2023) also examined this language pair in\nthe Net\ufb02ix series Wednesday. The study found that the subtitles\nemployed\n\ufb01ve\ntranslation\nstrategies,\nfour\nof\nwhich\nwere\ndomesticating while only one was foreignizing. This highlights\nthe relevance of culture and the challenges posed by cultural\ndifferences in the rendition of idioms.\nSutrisno et al. (2023) conducted a descriptive qualitative study\nto analyze the translation strategies used in translating idiomatic\nexpressions in Beauty and the Beast movie. With the use of two\nsubtitles, SL English and TL Bahasa Indonesia, taken from\nSubscene.com, the qualitative data was contrasted and examined\nin a descriptive way. The researcher employs expert theories from\nbooks, papers, and the internet to support the research. Each\nidiomatic expression and its translation were categorized by the\nresearcher using Baker\u2019s idiomatic translation methodologies. The\nresearchers found ten idiomatic expressions in the movie and\ndivided them into three categories. Three idioms were translated\nby applying a paraphrasing strategy, three expressions were\nrendered by using similar meanings and forms, two expressions\nwere rendered by using similar meanings but dissimilar forms,\nand\n\ufb01nally,\nthe\nomission\nwas\napplied\nto\ntwo\nidiomatic\nexpressions. Based on the analysis, it can be inferred that the\nmost commonly employed idiomatic translation strategies for\nidiomatic expression in the Beauty and the Beast movie are\nparaphrasing and using similar meanings and forms. This data\ndemonstrates that there are idiom-matching restrictions between\nBahasa Indonesia and English and that paraphrasing can be\nuseful when the target language lacks a comparable idiom.\nThis study centers on Arabic and English with a focus on\nEgyptian culture and its vernacular in the area of audiovisual\nmedia and its translation. This sets it apart from similar studies\nthat examine idiom translation in different languages and\ntranslation modes. Therefore, this paper \ufb01lls the research gap\nleft in this area.\nARTICLE\nHUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-024-03327-4\n4\nHUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS |  (2024) 11:949 | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-024-03327-4\nMethods and procedures\nThe English subtitling of the idiomatic expressions that are used\nin the Egyptian Movies \u201c\nThe Great Chinese\nBeans,\u201d and \u201c\nThe Humans and The Mongoose\u201d are\nanalyzed and assessed in this paper qualitatively. The \ufb01rst step\nwas manually transcribing these expressions as they occurred in\nthe Egyptian vernacular in the movies. This represented the\nsource text. The English subtitles for these lines were extracted\nfrom www.Net\ufb02ix.com to represent the target text. Since Net\ufb02ix is\na leading global streaming platform that aims to provide quality\nsubtitles, a level of adequacy is expected. The platform\u2019s guide-\nlines for subtitling will be further discussed below. The source and\ntarget text were then aligned then checked by three MA candi-\ndates in Audiovisual Translation. These MA candidates possess\nboth an educational background and practical experience in the\n\ufb01eld, which inform their analysis. After the parallel corpus was\ncompiled, the translations were manually analyzed according to\nBaker\u2019s taxonomy to identify prevailing patterns. Incidents of\ninterest received additional attention and were highlighted in\nthis paper.\nThe selected movies. Different factors were considered to decide\nwhich types of movies to select. These include the movie\u2019s genre\nand revenues. The genre of the \ufb01rst movie, \u201cThe Great Chinese\nBeans,\u201d is comedy, and the genre of the second movie, \u201cThe\nHumans and The Mongoose,\u201d is comedy and horror. The gross\nearnings and revenues for the investigated movies were high,\nindicating popularity and wide audience reception. Table 1\nincludes some information about the movies: genre, year of\nproduction, duration, and revenues.\nThe Great Chinese Beans is a comedy movie that attained\npopular success. The Humans and The Mongoose is considered\none of the most popular Egyptian movies of 2021; it achieved very\nhigh pro\ufb01ts and viewership. The star of both movies is Mohamed\nHenedi, a well-known Egyptian comedian and actor who is well-\nrecognized for his humorous roles, which often dominate the box\nof\ufb01ce.\nData collection and corpus compilation. The data comprised the\nEnglish subtitles of the idiomatic expressions found in two\nEgyptian \ufb01lms in comparison to their source texts. A corpus was\ncompiled by downloading the English subtitles and aligning them\nwith the manually transcribed source text. Table 2 clari\ufb01es this\nprocedure through a set of examples.\nStudy procedures. The procedures and steps that are followed in\nthis study are as follows. The \ufb01rst step taken in this study was the\nselection of the \ufb01lms. After this, the dialogues in the Egyptian\nmovies were manually transcribed. This transcription was then\naligned with the English subtitles which were extracted from\nNet\ufb02ix. Finally, the idiomatic expressions were analyzed and\ncompared in order to examine the challenges they posed and\nwhich strategies were employed to overcome them. The effec-\ntiveness of said strategies was also assessed.\nResults and \ufb01ndings\nThe use of idiomatic expressions is found in abundance in\nEnglish vernacular. Linguistic and geographical neighbors of\nEgypt have become accustomed to this usage as well. These\nidioms stem from the language, culture, and religion of the\nlocation and are used for a variety of reasons to express many\nnotions and emotions. These communicative properties call for\nadequate translation, which is why they are examined in this\npaper.\nTables 3\u201310 show examples of the translation strategies used in\nrendering thirty-one idiomatic expressions mentioned in the\ninvestigated movies. \u201cCultural substitution\u201d, \u201cparaphrasing using\nunrelated word\u201d and \u201cliteral translation\u201d are the three most\ncommon translation strategies that are used in translating idio-\nmatic expressions.\nTranslation by cultural substitution. Starting with the idioms\nthat are translated by using cultural substitution, which means\nsubstituting certain cultural terms from the source language for\nequivalent ones in the target language to \ufb01t the target culture\nbetter (Table 3).\nIn example 1, when a character is full of contempt for another,\nhe wishes death upon her. The exact phrasing used was \u201cMay\nAllah (God) take her.\u201d According to Farghal (1993), the religious\nand cultural backgrounds of Arabs lead them to view people as\nthe object of death, while Western views place people as the\nsubject. Furthermore, while invoking God in conversation is a\nregular habit for Arabs, only a small section of English speakers,\ntypically Christian, refer to God in their everyday speech aside\nfrom some interjections like \u201coh my god\u201d. Thus, a literal\ntranslation would result in an unnatural line in the target\nlanguage. Resorting to a functional approach could result in the\nline \u201cI hope she dies.\u201d This rendition conveys the sense of the\nutterance but removes the features of its form. Replacing the\nsource text with a target language idiom retains its sense and\nsome of its aesthetics. Hence, the subtitler employed the target\nlanguage idiom \u201ckick the bucket,\u201d retaining sense and aesthetics\ndespite\nthe\ninevitable\ncultural\nloss\nthat\nis\nintrinsic\nto\nnaturalization.\nExamples 2 and 3 are also examples of how religion is regularly\nmentioned in the daily speech of Arabs. Example 2 contains the\nphrase \u201cpeace be upon you,\u201d which is the Muslim greeting. This\ngreeting is even used by non-Arabic-speaking Muslims in its\nArabic form. Although it is religious in nature and origin, it is\nused as a casual greeting. However, in a Western context, it would\nseem unnatural and out of place in a random conversation. Thus,\nto reduce the foreignness of the phrase, the less alienating\neveryday \u201chello\u201d was subtitled in its place.\nExample 3 is perhaps the phrase that emphasizes the religion of\nthe people in the conversation the most. To calm down others,\nArabs often request that they \u201cpray on the Prophet.\u201d This\nreminds the people of their religious role model, which convinces\nthem to improve their attitude. To non-Muslims, this effect is out\nof reach as they have no connection to the Prophet. Thus, to\nachieve a similar effect, a more generic request must replace it,\nleading to the subtitle \u201ccalm down.\u201d\nTable 1 Movies\u2019 genre, year of production, duration, and revenues.\nNo.\nThe name of the movie\nGenre\nYear of Production\nDuration\nRevenues\n1\nThe Great Chinese Beans (\n)\nComedy\n2004\nOne hour 39 m\n11,000,000 EGP\n2\nThe Humans and The Mongoose (\n)\nComedy/horror\n2021\nTwo hours\n53,000,000 EGP\nHUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-024-03327-4\nARTICLE\nHUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS |  (2024) 11:949 | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-024-03327-4\n5\nThese examples indicate that religion can cause challenges for\nsubtitlers in a similar manner to culture. This area highlights the\nrelevance of pragmatics alongside naturalness and familiarity\nwhen conveying the sense of the ST to the target audience.\nIn example 4, the idiom \u201cWhat is this heartache?\u201d is used to\nexpress annoyance. This idiom is a form of exaggeration that\nimplies that the frustration caused by the person or situation is\naffecting the speaker\u2019s physical health. Here, the heartache may be\nseen as a result of a heart attack or stroke resulting from the\nannoyance. In English, however, heartache is often related to\nbroken love and disappointment. Hence, translating the term\nliterally would not only fail at conveying the intended sense but\nwould provoke a new, unrelated meaning. Therefore, it was\nnecessary for the phrase to be substituted, which led to the subtitler\nemploying the expression \u201cpain in the ass\u201d. This expression\nproperly conveys the intended sense but alters the register by\nincluding a taboo word.\nExample 5\nwas rendered as \u201cgood riddance.\u201d\nThe Arabic expression is considered one of the funny comedic\nterms commonly used in Egyptian movies and series, and it is\nconsidered a funny term despite the fact that it is said in a serious\nway in moments of quarrel and anger. Literally, it means \u201cwith\nsixty hells\u201d; however, the subtitler chose to use an equivalent idiom\nto translate it. \u201cGood riddance\u201d is an idiom that means when you\nare happy when someone is gone. The connotative meaning was\nconveyed successfully, and it is better than translating it literally.\nExamples 6 and 7 both contain animal symbolism. In example\n6, one character calls another an owl as an insult. In Arabian\nculture, owls are seen as bad omens. Traditionally, Arab people\nusually liken a person who is always pessimistic and angry to an\nowl. In Arab mythology, the owl bird represents anxiety and bad\nluck. The Arabs were gloomy about the owl bird in pre-Islamic\ntimes, seeing it as a symbol of death and devastation. They thought\nthat an owl visiting a person\u2019s home would be a sign of impending\ndeath and a sign of gloom. The old proverb, \u201cFollow an owl, and it\nwill guide you to ruin,\u201d was common in the ancient Arab tradition.\nThis contrasts greatly with the symbolism of owls in the West,\nwhere they represent knowledge and wisdom. The differing\nsymbolisms result in non-equivalence even with literal translations.\nThis led the subtitler to exchange this metaphor with a likening to\na devil. Although this rendition portrays the negativity of the\nsource text it diverges from the form and degree of the source text.\nFurthermore, it invokes religious concepts which were otherwise\ndeemed foreignizing. Instead, the translator could have retained\nthe comparison to a bird by replacing the owl with a crow, which\ncarries similar connotations in the target culture.\nIn example 7, a person is likened to a \u201c\nalghudanfar,\u201d\nwhich is a term for a large, strong lion to describe his ferocity.\nRendering this term simply as a lion could weaken its\nimplications but would still be acceptable. To fully encapsulate\nthe ferocity of the lion of the source text and retain the\nstrangeness of the term, the translation could have likened the\nman to the mythological Nemean lion. Yet, the subtitlers still\nresorted to substitution. In the target text, the man was likened to\na hulk, which is a large thing or person.\nThese examples emphasize how symbolism and metaphor are\nnot universal. This becomes an area of challenge when rendering\nidioms as literal translations may cause drastic shifts in meaning.\nThis indicates that nonsensical renditions are not the worst\npossibility of the misapplication of translation strategies.\nLiteral Translation. In the examined data, some examples were\ntranslated literally (Table 4). Idioms, however, cannot be\nTable 2 Aligning the Arabic texts, including idioms, with their English subtitles.\nSource Text (Eqyptian Vernacular)\nTarget Text (English)\nAnd if you lose, Shahawi, good riddance then!\nYes, but you know that my \ufb02esh is very bitter.\nOh no, sir, I can\u2019t.\nLove will blind him.

This\nphrase is similar in form and meaning to the English idiom \u201clove\nis blind.\u201d Both expressions indicate that loving someone clouds a\nperson\u2019s judgment, resulting in biased and unrealistic feelings.\nSince the phrase is used in both languages to convey the same\nmeaning, a literal rendition is acceptable. While the exact\nphrasing differs slightly, like the tense, for instance, the meaning\nis still accessible to the target audience.\nExample 9 is similar to example 8 as it contains an idiom that is\nused in both languages. The expression \u201cwhat a jinx\u201d is used when\na person senses that nothing is going their way for inexplicable\nreasons and can only be rationalized as bad luck.\nExample 10 includes the saying Muslims use when faced with\nthe death of someone they care about. It is a reminder that death\nis inevitable. To Muslims, this line is equivalent to the Christian\n\u201cdust to dust, ashes to ashes.\u201d Since Christianity is more common\namong anglophones, this phrase has become known to most\nEnglish speakers. Therefore, it would have been an acceptable\nrendition as it conveys the same sentiment. However, taking this\napproach would replace the connotations of the Islamic religion\nwith those of Christianity. The translator decided to retain the\noriginal line, maintaining the characters\u2019 religious identity.\nAlthough literal translation was used on this cultural expression,\nthe meaning was not lost on the audience as the sense of the\nphrase is clear from its components.\nExample 11 is an excerpt from a poem by the Arab poet Abu\nAl-Tayeb Al-Mutanabbi, which is uttered by one of the\ncharacters. When rendering literary allusions, a translator may\nreplace the quote with a similar one from the target culture. Since\nthe subtitler could not \ufb01nd a substitution, the line was translated\nliterally. This is an acceptable strategy that retains the cultural\nelements of the source text. Yet, non-Arab viewers are probably\nunfamiliar with the poem from which the line is quoted.\nTherefore, the fact the line is a reference may go unnoticed by\nthem. Placing the excerpt between quotation marks could deliver\nthis fact regardless of the audience\u2019s level of familiarity.\nIn example 12, a character exclaims that he refuses to be belittled\nwith an idiomatic expression. The expression states, \u201cMy \ufb02esh is\nbitter\u201d, implying that it is not easily edible, metaphorically\ndescribing the person\u2019s willingness to \ufb01ght back. This line is\ntranslated literally, resulting in an incomprehensible subtitle. Like\nmost idioms, the intended meaning is derived from previous\nknowledge and not linguistic components. Since content is separate\nfrom form, formal equivalence is mostly irrelevant, as highlighted\nby this example. Instead, such expressions are better translated\nbased on their sense with common or idiomatic language.\nOmission. In some expressions, the subtitler chooses to use the\nomission strategy either because there is no equivalent when they\nencounter forbidden words or because there is repetition; trans-\nlators may choose to exclude certain words (Table 5). Never-\ntheless,\nsome\ntranslators\nemploy\nthis\nstrategy\nrandomly,\nneglecting to consider the signi\ufb01cance of the context or the\ninformation being delivered. In general, omitting something is\nnot a good idea and should only be used as a last resort because it\noccasionally has the potential to change the meaning entirely.\nThe utterance in example 13 is deeply cultural and stems from\nthe beliefs of Muslims and Arabs. It is believed that being envious\nof the blessings of others may jinx them. This jinx is known as\n\u201c\n\u201d, which is the Arabic term for envy. To avoid spoiling the\nblessings of others, Muslims recite \u201cin the name of God, God\nwilling\u201d as a form of prayer that acts as a reminder of the source\nof all blessings. The concept of envy is similar to that of the evil\neye and that of jinxing good luck. Yet, even these Western\nconcepts are not as popular in their cultures. To avoid jinxes,\nEnglish speakers often use the phrases \u201ctouch wood\u201d or \u201cknock\non wood\u201d. However, the context in which these expressions are\nused is more limited than that of the source text. Mostly, they are\nused to hoping things go well in the future with less concern for\nTable 4 Examples of translation idiomatic expressions literally.\nStrategy\nNo.\nSource text (Arabic)\nLiteral translation\nTarget text\nLiteral\n8\nLove will blind him\nLove will blind him\n9\nWhat a jinx\nWhat a jinx\n10\nWe belong to Allah and to Him we shall return.\nTo Allah, we belong, and to Him, we will return.\n11\nIf death is inevitable, then it is a shame to die a\ncoward.\nIf death is inevitable, it is a shame to die a\ncoward.\n12\nYes, I remembered it.

Thus, the phrases are not interchangeable even when\ndisregarding the religious connotations of the source text. In this\nexample,\nthe\nutterance\nwas\nstill\nmeaningful\nwithout\nthe\ninterjection, which led the subtitler to omit it.\nExamples 14 and 15 highlight how general sense was\nprioritized over culture in this translation. The phrase \u201cwith\ngod\u2019s blessing\u201d did not appear in the target text. Instead, the\nsubtitle simply states, \u201cok then\u201d. The source text emphasizes\nArabs\u2019 relationship to God and how they entrust even the most\nbasic aspects of their lives to Him.\nIn example 15, the expression \u201cpray on the prophet\u201d appears\nagain. In this utterance, it is preceded by the line \u201cCalm down.\u201d\nSince calming down is the implicature of the phrase, and culture\nis being subsided in this translation, the phrase was omitted.\nReusing the same rendition as discussed above would have caused\nredundancy.\nExample 16,\n\u201cyour goodness preceded\u201d was not\nrendered. Of course, the literal translation does not convey the\nexact meaning of the SL expression, which is considered one of the\nexpressions of courtesy. It means that a person\u2019s goodness and\ngenerosity are very great for others and that he is a generous and\ngiving person who has many favours for people. This phrase is\nalso used to express gratitude in some situations as if you\u2019re telling\nhim/her that you haven\u2019t done much and that your efforts pale in\ncomparison to what he/she initially gave to you. However, the\nsubtitler could have translated the SL expression as \u201cIt\u2019s the least I\ncan do in return\u201d or \u201cI can never repay you for all you\u2019ve done.\u201d\nParaphrase using a related word. Another translation strategy\nthat is used to translate the idiomatic expressions is translation by\nparaphrasing using a related word (Table 6). This is used when\nthe idea expressed by the source item is lexicalized in the target\nlanguage but in a different form. There are four expressions\ntranslated by using this strategy.\nWhile most idioms are created from words unrelated to their\nsense, there are cases where the keyword re\ufb02ects part of the\nmeaning of the idiom. Since the sense is related to the main\nelement, the word can be retained in the translation even when\nparaphrase is employed. This is evident in examples 17\u201320.\nIn Example 17,\nwas translated as \u201cGet out of my\nsight\u201d. The Egyptian expression is used a lot in different contexts\nand conversations to express anger at someone. It means to go\ntoo far or disappear now. The same expression exists in the TL\nwith the same connotation meaning. Therefore, we can argue that\nthe subtitler chose the appropriate expression in the TL to\ntranslate the SL one.\nExample 18 contains the idiom \u201cYour secret is in a well\u201d. This\nmetaphorical expression assures the person that the speaker is\ntrustworthy and would keep their secret. The meaning of this\nexpression states that the secret will be well kept in a deep, dark\nplace rather than out in the open. The subtitles paraphrase the\nline to convey its meaning. The rendition states, \u201cYour secret is\npreserved.\u201d This statement retains the word secret and the sense\nof the idiom while diverging from its idiomatic form.\nIn example 19, a character is urged to be respectful in their\nattitude and manners. The Arabic text states, \u201cRespect yourself,\u201d\nwhile its English translation states, \u201cShow some respect.\u201d These\nphrases, which are identical in function and similar but not exact\nin form, show the differing views of respect between the two\ncultures. In Arabian culture, it is believed that one\u2019s manners are\na re\ufb02ection of themselves and their upbringing. Thus, it is their\nduty to retain respect for the sake of their character. On the other\nhand, \u201cshow some respect\u201d indicates that respect is related to\nother people. Furthermore, it is something that is given based on\nthe merit of the other person and thus collocates with the terms\n\u201cowe\u201d and \u201cearn.\u201d This led the subtitler to paraphrase the source\ntext and change the object of the sentence.\nExample 20,\nwas translated as\n\u201cSpeak well or hold your tongue.\u201d The literal translation of this\nexpression is \u201cEither you say a kind word or keep quiet.\u201d The SL\nexpression is used when two people are quarreling, and a third\nperson says something that increases the problem between them,\nso it is said to the third person either to say what makes them\ncalm down or to keep silent. The provided translation conveys the\nmeaning appropriately since the meaning of the idiom \u201chold your\ntongue\u201d is not to speak and keep silent. There is another\nexpression that conveys the same meaning as well: \u201cSay well or be\nstill.\u201d\nParaphrasing using unrelated word. Since the sense of an idiom\nis not intrinsically linked with the sense of its lexical components,\nthe same meaning can be presented through unrelated terms.\nThis paraphrase can also be done between two languages. This\ncan be seen in the examples in Table 7 where the sense of the\nidiom was rendered by discarding its form through the strategy of\nparaphrase.\nExample 21 contains the idiom \u201cplace it (as) a piercing in your\near\u201d. This line is metaphorical as the pronoun \u201cit\u201d does not refer\nto an actual earring but instead represents an utterance. The\nidiom is used to notify the listener that what is about to be said is\nof importance and should not leave the person\u2019s thoughts. The\nidea here is that speech enters the human mind through their\nears. Since earrings stay on a person\u2019s ears for prolonged periods,\nthe speaker asks that this statement does the same. A direct way\nto convey this is by saying, \u201cKeep this in mind,\u201d which is the line\nthat appeared in the subtitle.\nExample 22 states, \u201cWon\u2019t take a water\u2019s boil;\u201d this expression\nis used to express the swiftness and ease one plan to execute their\nTable 6 Examples of translation idiomatic expressions by paraphrase using a related word.\nStrategy\nNo.\nSource text (Arabic)\nLiteral translation\nTarget text\nparaphrase using a\nrelated word\n17\nGet lost, then.\nGet out of my sight\n18\nDon\u2019t worry.

This expression is replaced with the phrase \u201cwouldn\u2019t last\na second\u201d. This phrase references time, implying the ease of the\naction with the speed it is completed in, as the dif\ufb01culty of the\ntask typically increases the time its execution requires.\nIn example 23 one character describes his friendship with\nanother with the idiom \u201csoul with soul\u201d. This expression is used\nto\ndescribe\na\ndeepness\nand\ncloseness\nin\na\nrelationship,\ndistinguishing it from surface-level relationships. Typically, such\na bond is rare and exclusive. In other words, such a description is\nreserved for one person. Therefore, the friend described with this\nidiom must be the person\u2019s best friend. The term best friend was\nthe provided equivalent on this basis. However, describing this\nidiom as an indirect way to refer to a best friend oversimpli\ufb01es\nand diminishes aspects of its meaning. Therefore, while this\nrendition is acceptable, it is not an exact equivalent.\nExample 24,\nwas rendered as \u201cLife\nis full of surprises.\u201d The literal translation of the SL idiom is\n\u201cWhoever lives will see.\u201d The SL idiom means that in your\neveryday life, you will face different stances and situations that\nmake you learn more and increase your awareness in this life, so\nthe longer one lives, the more strange things he sees, the more\nexperienced he gets. This idiom is said to a young person who still\ndoes not have enough experience, and he/she witnesses or sees a\nsituation for the \ufb01rst time and gets shocked or surprised, or when\na person himself sees a strange situation, so he says it to himself.\nHowever, the subtitler paraphrased the implicit meaning of the\nidiom, and the meaning could be clear, but there are better\nequivalents that could be more appropriate and understandable to\nthe target audience, such as \u201cLive and learn\u201d and \u201cyou haven\u2019t\ngone anywhere or done anything.\u201d\nExample 25,\nwas translated as \u201cIt won\u2019t happen.\u201d\nThe literal translation of the SL idiom \u201cDie, donkey!\u201d. It is an\nidiom that the Egyptians repeat to indicate negligence and\nprocrastination in completing a task, or in some cases, a task that\nwill not be completed at all. For the purpose of evaluating the\ntranslation, we have to shed light on the story behind this idiom.\nAccording to the narrations, this idiom goes back to an ancient\nruler who saw a donkey entering his orchard, so he ordered it to\nbe brought and killed. One of the ministers tried to convince him\nthat it was an animal that did not understand and should not be\nexecuted for doing this, but the ruler insisted on his position in\norder to teach the donkey the royal rules. To get out of the\nsituation, a man came forward and offered to the ruler that he\nwould teach the donkey the royal rules, but on the condition that\nthe ruler gives him a period of 10 years and a palace in which to\nlive to teach the donkey. The ruler agreed to this offer in exchange\nfor the fact that he would snap the man\u2019s neck if he failed in the\ntask of teaching the donkey the royal rules. So the man quickly\nwent out to tell his wife what had happened. She asked him what\nthe ruler would do to him because, of course, he would fail in his\nmission. He replied to her, saying: \u201cAfter ten years, either the\nruler will die, or I will die, or the donkey will die.\u201d and \u201cDie,\ndonkey!\u201d. And since that time, people started to use\nas an idiom. The provided translation conveyed the intended\nmeaning. However, there is an equivalent in the TL that says,\n\u201cYou have to wait donkey\u2019s years.\u201d\nUsing an idiom of similar meaning but a different form. Using\nan idiom of similar meaning but a different form is common\nwhen translating idiomatic expressions (Table 8). The two fol-\nlowing examples were rendered by applying this strategy.\nExample 26 contains an idiom that is used to tell another\nperson not to interfere. The exact wording states, \u201cStick to\nyourself\u201d. While this string of words means \u201cdo not interfere with\nmy business\u201d in Arabic, in English they have a different use.\nTherefore, a literal translation would shift the sense from that of\nthe source text to mean \u201cminimize your social interactions\u201d\ninstead. This indicates that literal translation would be unac-\nceptable. Hence, the line was subtitled as \u201cmind your own\nbusiness\u201d, expressing the correct sense instead of following the\noriginal form. Moreover, since the target language phrase is also\nan idiom, the idiomatic nature of the utterance was retained\nminimizing stylistic loss.\nThe idiom \u201cthe weather is safe\u201d in example 27 is used to inform\nan accomplice that they can proceed safely without being caught.\nIn other words, there is no one around to witness the act, allowing\nthe person to progress their plans. This idiom is used in the same\ncontexts as the English idiom \u201cthe coast is clear\u201d to express the\nsame meaning. Thus, the English idiom replaced the Arabic\nidiom as its source text equivalent.\nTransliteration. Example 28 was translated by applying the\ntransliteration strategy, which means writing the Arabic word in\nEnglish letters (Table 9). Translators usually resort to this strategy\nwhen the source language word does not exist in the target lan-\nguage. The acceptability and effectiveness of transliteration are\naffected by the text context and cultural and linguistic context.\nFor instance, it can be used to retain cultural \ufb02avor when a for-\neignized approach is followed, or it may be used more naturally\nwhen a word becomes familiar as it slowly enters the lexicon as a\nloan word.\nThe phrase \u201cInshallah,\u201d which literally translates as \u201cGod\nwilling,\u201d is used by Muslims on a daily basis. Although the term is\nin Arabic, its religious connotations led to its use among non-\nArabic speakers. While its use is mostly limited to Muslims, its\nTable 7 Examples of translation idiomatic expressions by paraphrasing using unrelated word.\nStrategy\nNo.\nSource text (Arabic)\nLiteral translation\nTarget text\nparaphrasing using\nunrelated word\n21\nI\u2019ll tell you something and place it (as)\na piercing in your ears.\nI\u2019ll tell you something.

This allows for some\nacceptability in its retention, yet the possibility of unfamiliarity\nand a resulting lack of understanding is still a high risk.\nTherefore, a more direct translation strategy may have been better\nsuited.\nMistranslation. In some examples, the subtitler mistranslated the\nSL expression either because he didn\u2019t understand the meaning of\nit or because of the lack of searching for a suitable meaning (Table\n10). The following three examples were mistranslated.\nExample 29 contains the phrase \u201c\n\u201d. This\nphrase comes from a Qur\u2019anic verse and is used as a prayer. The\nliteral translation of the utterance is \u201cAllah is Suf\ufb01cient for me,\nand He is the Best Disposer of affairs\u201d and is used mostly in\nmoments of helplessness, more speci\ufb01cally oppression. The\nspeaker asks God for both aid and patience when they know\nthat there is nothing else they can do. This use differs from the\nuse of the exclamation \u201cgoodness gracious\u201d which replaced it in\nthe target text. Here the sense was shifted from a request for\nstrength and support to an expression of surprise. This classi\ufb01es\nthis rendition as a translation error. Instead, the line could have\nbeen rendered as the English prayers \u201cLord help me\u201d or \u201cLord\ngive me strength\u201d or had its intention explicated as \u201cmay God\ndeal with you\u201d.\nExample 30, \u201cfrom the star,\u201d is used to describe the early\nmorning. Although there are countless stars in the night sky, the\nidiom refers to a speci\ufb01c star, which is the sun. In other words,\nthe idiom is the equivalent of the English saying \u201cthe crack of\ndawn.\u201d However, instead of using this phrase or other possible\nequivalents like \u201cthe break of day\u201d or \u201cbright and early,\u201d the target\ntext states \u201cat the earliest.\u201d This phrase is a clause and not a\ncomplete sentence. If the phrase was preceded by a time, it\nindicates that the thing at hand will not happen before then. This\ndoes not align with the sense of the original utterance. If the\nclause had been preceded by a phrase like \u201copportunity\u201d or\n\u201cchance possible,\u201d then it could have been an acceptable\nrendition. The state in which it occurred can only be classi\ufb01ed\nas a mistranslation.\nExample 31 is an expression of gratitude. The literal wording\nstates, \u201cYour favor is above my head\u201d. This means that the person\nwill always honor what the other has done and never forget it. To\ntranslate the sense of this phrase, the line \u201cI will forever be\ngrateful\u201d is appropriate. The subtitles state, \u201cI will never forget\nyour kindness.\u201d Though this rendition would generally be seen as\nan accurate equivalent, it is considered a mistranslation here. The\nsubtitler uses explication, specifying the favor as kindness. Yet the\ncontext of the movie shows that the favor was far from kindness.\nIn fact, the character claims he appreciates the harshness his\ngrandfather showed, which he believes makes him stronger.\nDiscussion\nSeveral studies have been conducted concerning translating idioms,\nthe reasons behind the dif\ufb01culties in translating such expressions,\nas well as the most used strategies to translate them. According to\nprevious literature, it was found that the dif\ufb01culties translators\nencounter in rendering idiomatic and culturally bound expressions\ncan be due to many factors (Obeidat, 2023; Saed et al., 2023).\nFirstly, the degree of their familiarity with these idioms and cultural\nexpressions. Secondly, their linguistic ability to identify a suitable\nequivalent and the inability to translate these expressions using the\nproper or appropriate equivalent. Thirdly, the idiom is translated\nliterally without understanding it. Finally, there is a lack of\nknowledge of translation strategies. It was also found that the most\ncommon strategies used for resolving these challenges include\nparaphrasing, followed by literal translation, followed by omission.\nThe analysis above demonstrated that when translating idio-\nmatic expressions, literal translation is not always the best\nmethod to resort to. Moreover, the analysis also revealed that\nliteral translation did not accurately deliver the intended mean-\ning, and the target audience may not comprehend the implicit\nmeanings of the idiomatic expressions. Since the idiomatic\nexpressions are related to culture, subtitlers should make an effort\nto seek out the closest natural equivalent of the SL idiom in the\nTL culture. This is consistent with Nida (1964), who stated that\nthe translator\u2019s role is to ease the transmission of the message\nfrom one language to another and provide an equal response to\nthe recipients. However, if the subtitler does not \ufb01nd a suitable\nequivalent, the \u201cparaphrase\u201d strategy will be better used to\ntranslate the connotative meanings of the idiom, not its literal\ntranslation. By doing so, the implicit meaning of the idiom\nbecomes explicit and easier for the target audience to understand.\nThis is in harmony with Baker (1992), who stated that the\nstrategy of paraphrasing is used when there is no TL idiomatic\ncounterpart for the SL idiom or when the target language\u2019s style is\ndifferent from the SL; the paraphrasing approach is applied. Such\na \ufb01nding is in harmony with the outcome of Al-Assaf (2019), who\nconducted a study about translating idioms from English to\nArabic based on Baker\u2019s taxonomy of translation strategies of\nidioms; she found that paraphrasing strategy was regularly used\nin translating English idioms into Arabic.\nThe \ufb01ndings of this research study are in line with Ali and Al-\nRushaidi (2017), who studied the challenges of translating idio-\nmatic expressions and found that the major dif\ufb01culties are related\nto \ufb01nding proper equivalents, misunderstanding the idiom\u2019s\nmeaning, using literal translation, and eliminating the full or a\nportion of the idiom without compensation. These results have\nbeen con\ufb01rmed by the current study, particularly the section about\nmistranslating the idioms due to misunderstanding of the SL\nexpression, unfamiliarity with the TL culture, or inability to seek\nout a suitable equivalent. The current study found that cultural\nexpressions, especially idiomatic expressions that have a religious\nbackground or are related to culture, are challenging to subtitlers.\nSuch expressions are not lexicalized in the target language, and\nthis is, according to Baker (1992), one of the common problems of\nnon-equivalence. Furthermore, the analysis indicates that applying\nTable 8 Examples of translation idiomatic expressions using an idiom of similar meaning but a different form.\nStrategy\nNo.\nSource text (Arabic)\nLiteral translation\nTarget text\nUsing an idiom of similar meaning but a different form\n26\nStick to yourself\nMind your own business\n27\nThe weather is safe, dad\nThe coast is clear, dad\nTable 9 Examples of translation idiomatic expressions by\nTransliteration.\nStrategy\nNo.\nSource text\n(Arabic)\nLiteral\ntranslation\nTarget text\nTransliteration\n28\nGod willing\nInshallah\nARTICLE\nHUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-024-03327-4\n10\nHUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS |  (2024) 11:949 | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-024-03327-4\nthe \u201ccultural substitution\u201d strategy is one way to address these\nkinds of situations (Dweik & Suleiman, 2013). This \ufb01nding is in\nline with Mughazy (2016), who proposes that substitution could\nbe one of the best translation strategies when facing expressions\nthat have cultural connotations. In addition, based on the exam-\nples above, this study revealed that \u2018cultural substitution\u2019 is the\nmost used translation strategy when rendering idioms.\nThis research can assist subtitlers in improving their abilities to\ntranslate idiomatic expressions. Both the source and target cul-\ntures should be familiar to subtitlers. They should go above and\nbeyond when translating idiomatic expressions since these types of\nexpressions demand the subtitlers to \ufb01nd appropriate and com-\nprehended equivalence in the target language. Subtitlers ought to\nmake every effort to steer clear of the omission method, especially\nif the language pairs have similar syntactic and semantic struc-\nturing. It is important to note that translators occasionally use the\nomission strategy when a phrase gives the entire statement a new\nring or is socially acceptable in language A but not in language B.\nFinally, it is worth noting that most movies frequently utilize\nidiomatic expressions; therefore, subtitlers should focus on\ndeveloping an appropriate and special glossary for that. Trans-\nlators can bene\ufb01t from this study, especially those who want to\nsubtitle movies. Students studying translation who are interested\nin translating idiomatic expressions may also \ufb01nd it useful.\nConclusions\nRendering idiomatic expressions is a complicated and challenging\narea of translation. This area of translation is dif\ufb01cult to avoid in\nAVT as many movies employ idiomatic translation to create a\nnatural-sounding dialogue with a cultural \ufb02avor. There are stra-\ntegies that subtitlers may employ to overcome this challenge.\nIdiomatic expressions do not derive their meaning from the\nwords that make up the sentence. Thus, literal translation that\nprovides the equivalent for each word is an inadequate strategy.\nInstead, the intended sense should be the priority of the rendition.\nTransmitting the accurate sense is possible through strategies\nsuch as paraphrase. Paraphrasing is an adequate strategy for\nrendering the intended meaning but may result in stylistic loss.\nSubstituting the source language idiom with a target language\nidiom could help maintain the idiomatic nature of the utterance.\nWhile conveying the sense of the text is the priority, there is also\nthe issue of culture. Some strategies may follow the conveniences of\nthe source language foreignizing the translation but retaining the\ncultural \ufb02avor. Other strategies could be more domesticating\nresulting in a more naturalized text. Foreignizing strategies include\nliteral translation and transliteration while domesticating strategies\ninclude paraphrasing and cultural substitution. Translators must\ndecide on an approach to provide a consistent translation style or\nmerge the two depending on context and relevance. Translations\nthat do not re\ufb02ect neither the sense, style, or culture of the source\ntext are mistranslations and are unacceptable.\nThis study investigated translating common Arabic idioms into\nEnglish. Subtitling of other formulaic sequences, such as lexical\nbundles, lexical phrases, and collocations, to mention a few, can\nbe covered in future studies. Moreover, the Egyptian dialect was\nexamined in this study; other Arabic dialects and language pairs\ncould be studied in future research. In addition, other scholars\ncan look at various movie genres, such as tragedy, action, and\nthrill, to mention a few. The volume of the data is another con-\nstraint. Only thirty-one cases were examined in this study.\nAdditional instances and data analysis based on other translation\ntheories can be conducted by other scholars. Furthermore, the\ncurrent study focused on the linguistic and cultural elements of\nsubtitling. Future studies may provide further insights into the\ninteraction of sound and image and the role they play in the\ntranslation of idioms. Emphasizing the in\ufb02uence of the multi-\nmodal nature of AV material and para and extra-linguistic fea-\ntures on translation strategies and audience perceptions.\nData availability\nThe datasets generated during and/or analyzed during the current\nstudy are available from the corresponding author upon reason-\nable request.\nReceived: 24 February 2024; Accepted: 10 June 2024;\nReferences\nAbu-Rayyash H, Haider AS, Al-Adwan A (2023) Strategies of translating swear\nwords into Arabic: a case study of a parallel corpus of Net\ufb02ix English-Arabic\nmovie subtitles.

The selected movie was produced in 2022 and aired on \nNetflix. After watching the movie and examining the subtitles, the \nresearchers grouped them into two main categories: culture-specific \nitems (CSIs) and Swear Words. The themes subcategorized under \nCSIs include i) idioms and proverbs, ii) terms of address, iii) religious \nexpressions, iv) oaths, and v) food and drinks. The themes identified \nin the movie and subcategorized under Swear Words include i) \nrelative-related, ii) sex-related, iii) animal-related, iv) excretion, \nand v) rudeness and disrespect. The study utilized the translation \nstrategies proposed by Baker (2001), Gottlieb (1992), and Mughazy \n(2016). The findings showed that the strategies used in translating \nidioms and proverbs are metaphorical approximation (idiom \nto idiom), metaphorization, and literalization (paraphrase). The \nstrategies used in rendering terms of address, religious expressions, \nfood & drinks are cultural adaptation, deletion, substitution, and \ngeneralization. Swear words were translated using various strategies: \nsubstitution, addition, deletion, or literal translation. The study \nconcluded that language could be creatively and strategically altered \nto capture cultural contexts, feelings, and underlying meanings. \nThese translation choices might not be merely linguistic tweaks but \ncalculated efforts to accurately capture the essence of the original \nexpressions with clarity and emotional resonance in the target \nlanguage.\nKeywords: culture-specific items, Netflix, swear words, subtitling, \ntranslation strategies\nResearch Article\nPublished in Nairobi, Kenya by \nRoyallite Global\nVolume 5, Issue 1, 2024\nArticle Information\nSubmitted: 5th October 2023\nAccepted: 25th December 2023\nPublished: 9th January 2024\nISSN: 2708-5945 (Print)\nISSN: 2708-5953 (Online)\nAdditional information is available \nat the end of the article: \nTo read the paper online, please scan \nthis QR code:\nHow to Cite: \nSaideen, B., Thalji , A., Lababaneh, \nA., Tartory, R. ., Haider, A.

Dubbing is a type of audiovisual \ntranslation that basically refers to replacing the source language\u2019s soundtrack with the target language\u2019s \nsoundtrack (Diaz-Cintas, 2009; Baker and Hochel, 2001). Subtitling, on the other hand, is the process of \nadding captions that are synchronized with the verbal text and displayed at the bottom of images or on \nscreens to present a translation of dialogues in audiovisual materials (Szarkowska, 2005). O\u2019Connell (2007) \ndefines subtitling as \u201csupplementing the original voice soundtrack by adding written text on screen\u201d (p.129).\nThis paper is concerned with subtitling as an essential aspect of AVT and the strategies that are \nutilized in rendering spoken language into written text displayed on the screen. Subtitles are used to convey \nthe meaning of dialogues of foreign audiovisual materials to viewers who are unfamiliar with the source \nlanguage. Subtitling has gained popularity in recent years as it makes these materials accessible to wider \naudiences in other languages and cultures. It allows an audience to enjoy foreign audiovisual materials \nwhich, without subtitling, would remain inaccessible to them. Compared to dubbing, subtitling is cost-\neffective and more inclusive. By providing on-screen descriptions of sounds and background noise, it makes \naudiovisual materials accessible to the deaf and hard of hearing (DHH), as well.\nSubtitling, however, is a highly demanding process burdened with difficulties and challenges \n(Karamitroglou, 2000). Gottlieb (2001) discusses formal quantitative and textual qualitative challenges. For \nexample, subtitles should achieve clarity, which entails using simple language, avoiding complex sentence \nstructures, and breaking up longer sentences into shorter ones. De Linde and Kay (1999) examine technical \ndifficulties related to time and space limitations, synchronization, retention time, and viewers\u2019 reading speed. \nTiming is crucial in subtitling because subtitles must be synchronized to appear on screen simultaneously \nwith the spoken dialogue. Subtitles should also be economical so that the number of words fits the screen \nin no more than two lines. They should be long enough to accurately convey the meaning of the dialogue \nbut short enough to be read quickly. Moreover, the font size and style used in subtitles can affect their \nreadability. Subtitles should be easy to read, so it is important to choose a font size and style that is clear \nand legible.\nIn addition, subtitling, like other types of translation, is accompanied by other challenges concerning \nlinguistic and cultural isomorphism between the concerned language pair. Subtitling requires certain \nstrategies that are commonly employed by subtitlers to overcome such challenges. These strategies refer to \nthe techniques and methods utilized by subtitlers to create clear, accurate, and effective subtitles. Gottlieb \n(2001), for example, proposes a set of strategies that include expansion, paraphrase, transfer, imitation, \ntranscription, dislocation, condensation, decimation, deletion, and resignation.\nThe accuracy of translations is critical in subtitling; otherwise, it can lead to dialogue confusion \nor misinterpretation. Subtitlers must ensure that their translations are accurate and convey the intended \nmeaning. To this end, they apply cultural adaptation, including changing idioms, cultural references, or \nother elements that may be incomprehensible to foreign audiences. They also apply localization, which \nPublic Interest Statement\nTranslation between Arabic and English is challenging due to the linguistic and cultural gaps. This study \nis concerned with the English subtitles of the Jordanian film The Alleys. It discusses the rendering of \nculture-specific items and swear words. The findings showed that the subtitlers used various strategies in \ntranslating the movie, including cultural adaptation, deletion, substitution, generalization, addition, and \nliteral translation. The findings have implications for content accessibility, cross-cultural communication, \nand audiovisual translation. The study stresses the value of coordinated efforts from translators, \nfilmmakers, and streaming services to provide subtitles that appeal to English-speaking viewers without \ndiminishing the original material. \nResearch Journal in Advanced Humanities\nPage 159\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\ninvolves adapting subtitles for specific regions or countries by using local dialects, spellings, or other regional \nvariations. Finally, it is worth noting that subtitling strategies can vary depending on the type of content \nbeing translated. For example, documentaries may require a more literal translation approach than dramas \nor comedies, where creative liberties can be taken with translations (Furgani, 2016).\nBuilding upon these established foundations, this paper undertakes a meticulous examination of \nthe translation strategies employed in the translation of the Jordanian film \u201cThe Alleys\u201d from Jordanian \nArabic into English, with emphasis on two linguistic elements found in the film dialogue, namely culture-\nspecific items (CSIs) and swearwords. A decent, censored version of the film played in local theatres, though \nthe uncensored version, which was released on Netflix on Jan. 5, 2023, reached a wider audience. The \nthriller, directed by the Jordanian director Bassel Ghandour, portrays the seedy underworld of Amman, \nshowcasing elements of its lowlife intrigue. Ghandour\u2019s multi-genre film, which was shot in Jabal Al Natheef \n- a claustrophobic, violent, Eastern Amman neighborhood- immediately gained notoriety for its contentious \nthemes and obscene language, sparking parliamentary debate and vigorous social media discussions upon \nits release, despite receiving support from certain liberal activists and local media outlets (Vivarelli, 2023). \nOriginal textual production, such as novels and poetry of Ayman Otoom ( A contemporary Jordanian \npoet and novelist), and AVT materials, such as The Alleys, incorporating controversial themes (sex, adultery, \nincest, obscene language, violence, political taboos, etc.), violate constraints imposed by taboo topics when \nintroduced into conservative societies, such as Jordanian society (See Haider, Al-Saideen, & Hussein, 2022). \nNegative reception by the audience and strict state censorship are expected in such cases (Al-Saideen, Haider, \n& Al-Abbas, 2022). \nDissemination of socially or politically dissident translated materials into Arab or Muslim conservative \ncommunities may also incur undesired consequences. Translators in this context are expected to uphold \na euphemizing approach to evade censorship and to soften the audience\u2019s reception of such materials. \nConsequently, translational precautionary measures would be taken to avoid unsolicited reactions. However, \nthis study is concerned with the English subtitle of the Jordanian film The Alleys. It would be interesting to \nfind out whether vulgarism was maintained, mitigated, or even boosted in the English subtitle of The Alleys. \nTo this end, this study thematically discusses the rendering of culture-specific items (CSIs) and swearwords \ndetected in this film into English. \n\t\nThe study attempts to answer the following questions:\n1.\t How are culture-specific items (CSIs) rendered in the English subtitling of the Jordanian vernacular \nmovie \u2018The Alleys?\n2.\t How are swear words rendered in the English subtitling of the Jordanian vernacular movie \u2018The \nAlleys?\nLiterature Review\nThis section comprises two parts: the first covers the theoretical background on CSIs and swear words. The \nsecond part reviews empirical studies already carried out on the translation of these two cultural aspects.\nTheoretical Background\nCulture-Specific Items (CSIs)\nThe function of a language transcends mere communication; it captures the very essence of a culture. \nPeople of a particular culture view the world from their own viewpoint. Larson (1984) notes that different \ncultures have different focuses and that this difference is reflected in the vocabulary available for discussing \na particular topic. Thus, a given society may employ both technical and non-technical vocabulary to refer \nto the same concept/thing. Newmark (1988) was the first to propose the idea of cultural words, which are \ntypically described in everyday language and cannot be translated literally. Baker (1992) refers to Newmark\u2019s \ncultural words as culture-specific concepts, which represent one of the types of non-equivalence at the word \nlevel, and notes that these concepts may be \u201cabstract or concrete; they may relate to a religious belief, a \nResearch Journal in Advanced Humanities\nPage 160\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\nsocial custom, or even a type of food\u201d (p. 21). As an example, Baker (1992) claims that the concept denoted \nby the English word speaker (of the House of Commons) has no equivalent in many other languages, \nincluding Arabic. Nonetheless, the term Culture-Specific Items (CSIs), coined by Javier Franco Aixela in \n1996, has gained widespread currency in the translation literature. Aixela (1996) describes the nature of \nthese CSIs as follows:\n\u201c\u2026in translation, a CSI does not exist of itself, but as the result of a conflict arising from \nany linguistically represented reference in a source text which, when transferred to a target \nlanguage, poses a translation problem due to the nonexistence or to the different value (whether \ndetermined by ideology, usage, frequency, etc.) of the given item in the target language culture\u201d \n(p. 57). \nTwo key points can be drawn from Aixela\u2019s description of a CSI: (i) a CSI occurs when a word (or a \ngroup of words) contains a culturally specific reference, and (ii) this culture-specific reference is either non-\nexistent in the target language or has a different value/meaning there. Aixela discusses the example of the \nword \u2018April\u2019 (from the first line of The Waste Land: \u2018April is the cruelest month\u2026\u2019) where he states that in \nEnglish, \u2018April\u2019 is associated with flowers and spring, whereas in Germany and Spain, it\u2019s \u2018May\u2019 that is used \nto signify this association (p.58).\nArabic, a language revered for its historical and cultural significance, contains a multitude of CSIs. For \ninstance, the idiomatic expression \u201c( \u201d\u0646\u0627\u062f\u062a \u0646\u064a\u062f\u062a \u0627\u0645\u0643kam\u0101 tad\u012bn tud\u0101n), which translates to \u201cas you sow, \nso shall you reap,\u201d emphasizes the concept of accountability in a manner that goes beyond mere emphasis. It \nreflects the culture\u2019s emphasis on personal responsibility in Arab societies. Similarly, the practice of offering \n\u201c( \u201d\u0629\u0648\u0647\u0642qahwa, Arabic for \u2018coffee\u2019), which refers to the Arabic coffee tradition, is an essential part of \nArabian hospitality. Not only is it a beverage, but it is also a symbol of a warm welcome, highlighting the \nsignificance of hospitality in Arab culture.\nWith that being stated, CSIs provide insights into a culture\u2019s norms, practices, and values and serve as \na means for understanding cultural diversity. Due to its long history and complex culture, Arabic provides \na vast array of such references, including proverbs and idioms, as well as religious rituals and practices. \nTranslation between Arabic and English highlights the difficulty of bridging the linguistic gap while \nmaintaining the cultural essence of these references. In the following section, we will discuss CSIs within the \ncontext of their translation from Arabic into English.\nSwearwords\nDespite being commonly perceived as rude and objectionable, profanities and expletives hold considerable \ncultural and emotional significance within linguistic discourse. The intricacy of human communication is \nevident in the utilization of words and phrases that frequently carry connotations of social prohibition, \nintense anger, or heightened significance (Jay and Janschewitz, 2008). According to A\u0301vila-Cabrera\u2019s (2016, \np. 29) taxonomy on offensive and taboo language, swearwords can be classified as a form of offensive \nlanguage. This classification encompasses three subcategories, namely abusive swearwords, expletives, and \ninvectives. While the act of \u2018swearing\u2019 serves several different functions in communication, Stapleton (2010, \np. 294-299) discusses various interpersonal functions, including expressing emotion, humor and verbal \nemphasis, social bonding and solidarity, and constructing and displaying identity. Consequently, the use of \nswearwords transcends the mere communicative function, as it also reflects cultural norms and values.\nIn Arabic, just like other languages, the selection of swearwords and vulgar expressions can provide \nvaluable insights into the cultural outlook on sensitive or taboo topics. For instance, the Arabic term \u201c \u201d\u0629\u0646\u0639\u0644\n(la\u02bfnah), which refers to \u201ccurse,\u201d carries a substantial cultural load as a result of its religious and cultural \nimplications. The act of swearing that involves invoking the name of God or employing expressions such \nas \u201c( \u201d\u0629\u064a\u0628\u0627\u0646 \u0629\u0645\u0644\u0643kalimah n\u0101biyah, Arabic for \u2018a profane word\u2019) in Arabic-speaking societies highlights \nResearch Journal in Advanced Humanities\nPage 161\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\nthe complex relationship between language, religion, and the concept of respect. In addition, it is worth \nnoting that Arabic expletives often incorporate references to family members or personal matters, thereby \nemphasizing the importance of familial bonds and privacy within the cultural context.\nEmpirical Studies\nThe interdependence of language and culture shapes how meaning is constructed and communicated. It is \nimportant to note that when conveying meaning through translation, it is a well-established fact that the \ntarget language does not uniformly capture the distinctive cultural elements, as both the source language \n(SL) and the target language (TL) belong to different cultural systems. Therefore, during the process of \ntranslation, it is common to encounter culture-specific terms, which often require significant efforts on \nthe part of the translator to effectively convey their meaning. Among these culture-specific elements are \nidioms, proverbs, and culture-bound expressions. Numerous scholars within the field of translation have \ninvestigated the strategies and difficulties of translating such expressions (See Sentov, 2020; Banikalef, 2019; \nDweik, 2013; Alrosan, 2012; Al-Saidi, 2013, among others). Their research reveals valuable insights for \nboth translators and researchers, as they offer significant implications and fresh perspectives on the various \ntranslation options available to translators to preserve or alter the cultural context of the ST.\nZitouni (2022) conducted a qualitative inquiry into the translation of cultural items in Romeo and \nJuliet from English to Arabic, where the interconnection between culture and translation was examined while \nalso addressing the difficulties associated with translating English cultural items. The findings of the study \nrevealed that the cultural aspect of Shakespeare\u2019s play made the translator opt for a wide range of translation \nstrategies, including functional equivalent, descriptive equivalent, transposition, and naturalization, in order \nto handle the cultural gaps between classical English and modern Arabic.\nSwearing is also culture-specific in the sense that people\u2019s swearing patterns differ according to the \nvery conservative and liberal nature of their cultures (See Haider et al., 2022). Reflecting the social, cultural, \nand emotional aspects of a language, swear words are a unique linguistic phenomenon that often carries a \nstrong emotional load (Stapleton, 2010). This load varies significantly due to different linguistic, historical, \nand cultural contexts. Accordingly, translators are accountable for dealing with the translational burden \ntriggered by such cultural nuances and communicating them thoughtfully, taking into consideration the \nmost appropriate translation norms of the translating language (Abu Rayyash et al., 2023).\nGiven how deeply ingrained swear words are in each language and culture, translating them between \nArabic and English can be challenging (Mounadil, 2023). As a language pair of translations, they belong \nto different families, Semitic and Germanic, respectively. This, by default, implies the natural exitance of \ncultural differences between them at the semantic and pragmatic levels. Such differences include how swear \nwords behave semantically and pragmatically in both languages (Al-Yassin & Rababah, 2019). Hence, \ntransferring them from one language to another has been within many researchers\u2019 interests.\nSeveral studies have been conducted to examine translation strategies of \u2018swearwords\u2019 as oral manners \nby which certain cultural differences grow marked and stressed. Abdelaal and Al Sarhani (2021) examined \ntranslation strategies and translation quality of subtitling swearwords in the \u201cTraining Day\u201d movie. The \nresearchers found that translating swearwords like fucking, fucked, bullshit, shit, and motherfucker was \nmostly through translation by euphemism and omission due to cultural factors and equivalence issues.\nRoughly, the same results were found by Abu-Rayyash et al. (2023), who investigated translation \nstrategies chosen by Netflix subtitlers to render 1564 swearwords from English into Arabic. Noticeably, \nthese studies and other further ones (see Al-Zgoul and Al-Salman, 2022; Debbas and Haider, 2020; Al-Yasin \nand Rabab\u2019ah, 2019; Al-Jabri, 2021) stress the fact that, in most cases, subtitlers\u2019 acts are marked by opting \nfor omission and euphemism strategies.\nHowever, other studies have been performed to investigate subtitling cases when the direction of \ntranslation is from Arabic into English, conservative to liberal. Haider et al. (2023), for example, studied \nthe translation strategies subtitlers chose to render the \u2018inappropriate language\u2019 and \u2018explicit scenes\u2019 of \nResearch Journal in Advanced Humanities\nPage 162\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\nthe Netflix-Jordanian vernacular series Jin. Following Ljung\u2019s swearing typology, the findings of the \nstudy revealed that taboo expressions in the series fulfilled frequent connotative functions as \u2018unfriendly \nsuggestions\u2019 and \u2018noun support,\u2019 which were rendered by subtitlers through various strategies. The results \nof the study also revealed that subtitlers opted for using translation by dysphemism (non-taboo to taboo) \nand taboo to taboo more frequently than euphemism or omission, as it is the most subtitling cases when \ntranslation is from English into Arabic (See Thawabteh & Al-Edwan, 2022; Haider & Hussein, 2022).\nHowever, such findings should not be generalized to other genres and registers when discussing how \ntranslation direction influences translators\u2019 decisions. Register, genre, and translator\u2019s ideology tremendously \ninfluence translators\u2019 choices; Lolita\u2019s English version, compared to its Arabic source counterpart, is a good \ncase in point (See Al-Saideen et al., 2022). \nExtensive research has been conducted on culture-specific items (CSIs) and swearwords. However, \nthe significance of this study in the field of translation studies, especially from Arabic to English, lies in its \nexamination of the complex subtleties involved in translating CSIs and swearwords. These two elements \npresent distinct challenges in cross-cultural communication.\nThis paper provides a comprehensive examination of translation practices by comparing the strategies \nused for these specific linguistic elements, with a dual focus on frequency and the justifications behind the \nchosen approaches. This dual perspective offers a more comprehensive understanding of the translator\u2019s \ndecision-making process and its impact on accurately conveying cultural and emotional nuances. Moreover, \nthe study has the potential to either validate or refute previous research in the field, which contributes \nto the continuing development of translation theory and practice, eventually enhancing cross-cultural \ncommunication and comprehension.\nMethodology\nFilm Description\nThe Alleys, which was directed by Bassel Ghandour, explores the lives and struggles of various characters in \nthe labyrinthine alleys of East Amman, Jordan, as they navigate the challenges of their everyday existence. \nThe film is known for its portrayal of different social classes, including the working class and those facing \neconomic hardships, whose lives collide and spiral into chaos and get interconnected within the urban \nsetting because of a blackmailing stalker who sets into motion a series of unintended events.\nCorpus Compilation\nThe data gathered for this study was taken from the 2021 Jordanian drama/thriller film \u201cThe Alleys.\u201d The \nfilm was accessed for the purpose of data collection through a valid subscription to the online streaming \nplatform Netflix. As a paid subscriber, access to the movie was obtained via the platform\u2019s official streaming \nservice. The film has a runtime of approximately 1 hour and 55 minutes. This subscription-based access \nallowed for the seamless viewing of the film, thereby ensuring compliance with the platform\u2019s terms of \nuse during the data extraction process. The status of being a legitimate subscriber underscores the ethical \nfoundation of this data collection approach. In addition, based on Netflix policies, the use of data for \neducational and pedagogical purposes is allowed.\nAs for subtitle quality and standards, Netflix prioritizes the precision and contextual appropriateness \nof subtitles in various languages, as these subtitles and captions are deemed Netflix\u2019s \u201cprimary assets.\u201d Thus, \nthe subtitles provided by Netflix are created with great attention to detail, aiming to faithfully capture the \nnuances of dialogue, cultural references, and idiomatic expressions. As a result, acquiring appropriate subtitle \nfiles in both English and Arabic was a key first step in building the bilingual corpus for our analysis. The \nEnglish subtitle file was acquired in .srt format, while the Arabic script was written manually. After that, the \nArabic utterances were aligned with their counterpart in the Excell sheet.

The third column includes Netflix English subtitles of the Arabic text. The second \ncolumn was intentionally added by the researchers to enable non-native Arabic speakers to understand the \nST and how it was translated into English. \nAs Table 1 shows, the examples extracted from The Alleys are grouped into two main categories, Culture \nSpecific Items (CSIs) and Swear Words, and subcategorized according to their themes. The themes identified \nin the movie and subcategorized under CSIs include i) idioms and proverbs, ii) terms of address, iii) religious \nexpressions, iv) oaths, and v) food and drinks. The themes identified in the movie and subcategorized under \nSwear Words include i) relative-related, ii) sex-related, iii) animal-related, iv) excretion, and v) rudeness and \ndisrespect.\nIn the analysis, and as Table 1 shows, the source utterance (in Arabic) will be translated literally \nResearch Journal in Advanced Humanities\nPage 164\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\ninto English by the researchers to make the texts accessible to non-native speakers of Arabic and to enable \nreaders to spot the changes that were made by the subtitler.  \nThe collected examples will be examined according to the taxonomies proposed by Baker (2001), \nGottlieb (1992), and Mughazy (2016).\nTranslation Strategies proposed by Baker (1992)\nBaker (1992, p. 26-42) lists eight translation strategies, which are that are frequently employed by translators \nto manage challenging issues during a translation task:\n1.\t Translation by a more general word: \nThe first strategy involves substituting a source-language expression with a more general word in \nthe TT. This is a widely adopted strategy that effectively manages various forms of nonequivalence. \nBaker asserts the universality of this strategy across languages because it relies on the shared \nsemantic field, transcending language-specific limitations.\n2.\t Translation by a more neutral/ less expressive word: \nThis strategy focuses on the structural aspect of meaning.\n3.\t Translation by cultural substitution\nThis strategy involves replacing a culture-specific expression with a target language counterpart, \nconsidering its impact on the intended audience. This strategy enhances the TT\u2019s naturalness, \ncomprehensibility, and familiarity to the target reader. The translator\u2019s choice to employ this \nstrategy is contingent upon two key factors: the extent of the license granted by the translation \ncommissioning parties and the intended purpose of the translation.\n4.\t Translation using a loan word or a loan word plus explanation:\nThis strategy is usually employed to manage culture-specific items, modern concepts, and \nbuzzwords. Using a loan word with an explanation proves advantageous when a word is repeated \nseveral times in the text. For the first time, the word is mentioned in the explanation, consequently \nenabling the term\u2019s standalone usage in subsequent occurrences.\n5.\t Translation by paraphrase using a related word:\nThis strategy is utilized in two ways: when the source item is lexicalized in the target language but \nin a different form and when the frequency with which a certain form is used in the source text \nsignificantly exceeds what would be considered natural in the target language.\n6.\t Translation by paraphrase using unrelated words:\nThis strategy is used when the concept in the source language lacks a direct counterpart in the \ntarget language. When the meaning of the source item is intricate in the target language, the \nparaphrase with unrelated words strategy can be employed, by altering a superordinate or simply \nby elucidating the source item meaning.\n7.\t Translation by omission:\nThis strategy proves to be very valuable in some contexts, particularly where omission does not \nhinder the comprehensibility of the source text. It is used to avoid lengthy explanations.\n8.\t Translation by illustration:\nEmploying this strategy can prove advantageous when the target equivalent fails to encompass \ncertain aspects of the source item, and the equivalent term pertains to a tangible entity that can be \neffectively depicted, thereby enabling concise and precise communication while avoiding excessive \nelaboration.\nTranslation Strategies proposed by Gottlieb (1992)\nGottlieb (1992, p.166) lists several subtitling strategies that include the following:\n\t\n1) Expansion is used when the utterance in the source language requires more explanation to ensure \nResearch Journal in Advanced Humanities\nPage 165\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\ncomprehension on the part of the audience; it occurs when the cultural nuance of the source language is \nunretrievable.\n\t\n2) Paraphrase is utilized when the original phrase cannot be syntactically reconstructed in the target \nlanguage. This means that the TT and ST are syntactically incommensurate, but the TT is still comprehensible \nto the target audience.\n\t\n3) Transfer is defined as the strategy of producing a correct and complete translation of the ST.\n\t\n4) Imitation is used with proper nouns or similar name forms, such as people\u2019s names, places, book \ntitles, country names, brand products, etc.\n\t\n5) Transcription is used in some cases where a foreign term exists in the source language.\n\t\n6) Dislocation in translation is used when the source language dialogue includes special effects, as \nseen, for example, in a cartoon film featuring a comical song. In such cases, the translation of the effect itself \ntakes precedence over the specific content being conveyed.\n\t\n7) Condensation is used due to spatio-temporal limitations in subtitling. The strategy is used to \nensure efficiency by eliminating redundancies.\n\t\n8) Decimation is applied when there is an extreme form. This happens when an important element, \nsuch as a taboo word, is omitted. It also happens when there is a quarreling scene, and the characters are \ntalking too fast.\n\t\n9) Deletion is defined as the total elimination of textual elements, e.g., repetitions, question tags, and \nfiller words.\n\t\n10) Resignation is used when the translator fails to find an equivalent term in the target language \nand the meaning is inevitably lost.\nTranslation Strategies proposed by Mughazy (2016)\nThe taxonomy proposed by Mughazy (2016) will be followed for the translation of idioms and proverbs. \nAccording to this model, figurative language can be translated by one of the following strategies: \n1.\t Literalization: It is most useful with cultural-specific idioms because they lack functional equivalents \nin the target language. It basically involves offering a description of the Arabic idiom by providing a \nnonfigurative translation. In essence, it entails providing an explanatory interpretation of the idiom.\n2. Metaphorical approximation represents a translation approach wherein the translator exerts efforts to \nfind the nearest equivalent of a metaphor in the target language. Furthermore, this technique involves the \ntranslation of idiomatic and frozen formulas by using figurative expressions in the target language that \nare closest in meaning to the source language expressions, although they may not be deemed functional \nequivalents.\n2.\t Metaphorization: is a translation process whereby texts are rendered metaphorically, using metaphors \nin the TT. This strategy stands in stark contrast to literalization; it\u2019s about using idioms to translate \nsemantically compositional phrases.\nAnalysis and Discussion\nCulture-Specific Items\nCultural-specific items (CSIs) denote elements firmly embedded in the heritage, convictions, and practices of \na specific culture. These elements encompass everything from idiomatic expressions, proverbs, and idioms to \ndistinct cultural rituals, attire, and customary cuisine. The translation of CSIs between Arabic and English can \nprove intricate, owing to the inherent cultural subtleties and disparities existing between the two languages. \nThis section is devoted to the examination and analysis of the themes mentioned in Table 1 above.\nIdioms & Proverbs\nTable 2 includes examples of idiomatic expressions and proverbs extracted from the movie The Alleys, along \nwith their corresponding literal translations and target texts. These idioms and proverbs play a significant \nResearch Journal in Advanced Humanities\nPage 166\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\nrole in delivering cultural nuances embedded in the movie\u2019s dialogue.\nTable 2\n Examples of idioms and proverbs as used in the movie\nTheme\n#\nStrategy\nSource Text\nLiteral Translation\nTarget Text\nIdioms & \nProverbs\n1\nMetaphorical \nApproxima-\ntion (Idiom to \nidiom)\n \u0644\u0643 \u0639\u0645\u0648\n \u0647\u0633\u0644 \u060c\u064a\u0643\u062d\u0644\u0627\u0647\n \u0631\u062b\u0643\u0623 \u064a\u0641\u062e\u0645\u0644\u0627\n\u0641\u0648\u0634\u0643\u0645\u0644\u0627 \u0646\u0645\nAnd with all this talk, \nwhat\u2019s hidden is still \nmore than what\u2019s re-\nvealed.\nBut all these \nfloating tales \ndon\u2019t even \nscratch the sur-\nface\n2\n \u0627\u0645\u064a\u0627\u062f\n \u0628\u0644\u062d \u0627\u0647\u0628\u0644\u062d\u062a\u0628\n\u2026\n \u0627\u0646\u0631\u0635\u0639\u062a\n\u0629\u0631\u0645 \u0644\u0643 \u0631\u0635\u0639\nAlways milking it ... \nYou squeeze us every \ntime.\nYou really \nsqueeze a dollar \nout of a dime.\n3\n \u0646\u0648\u0647\n \u0646\u0648\u0647\u0648 \u0627\u0646\u0631\u0641\u062d\n\u0627\u0646\u0641\u062f\nWe dug here and bur-\nied here.\nThey\u2019d take the \nsecret with them \nto their graves.\n4\n \u0646\u0645 \u060c\u0631\u0634\u062a\u0646\u062a\u0628\u0648\n \u0646\u0627\u062f\u0644 \u060c\u062f\u062d\u0627\u0648 \u0645\u062b\n \u0627\u0645 \u062f\u062d\u0644 \u060c\u064a\u0646\u0627\u062b\u0644\u0627\n \u0631\u0627\u062f \u0644\u0643 \u0644\u062e\u062f\u062a\n\u0629\u0631\u0627\u062d\u0644\u0627\u0628\nAnd it spreads from \none\u2019s mouth to anoth-\ner\u2019s, until it enters every \nhouse in the neighbor-\nhood.\nA story spreads \nlike wildfire\n5\n \u0649\u0641\u0635\u0648\n \u0627\u0644\u0648 \u0647\u0644\u063a\u0634 \u0627\u0644\n\u0647\u0644\u0645\u0639He ended up without a \njob or a profession.\nUntil he became \nnothing more \nthan a worthless \nbum.\n6\nMetaphoriza-\ntion \n \u0634\u0645 \u0647\u062a\u0646\u0627\n \u0646\u064a\u0645 \u0639\u0645 \u0641\u0631\u0627\u0639\n\u062a\u0639\u0642\u0648\nYou don\u2019t even know \nwho you fell with.\nYou\u2019re digging \nyourself a deep \nhole\n7\u0645\u0647\u064a\u0637\u0628\u0632Make them look nice\nDoll them up\n8 \u0631\u0635\u062a\u062e\u0627\n\u0629\u0644\u064a\u0644\u0644\u0627 \u0627\u0646\u064a\u0644\u0639Cut the night short\nLet\u2019s call it a \nnight\n9\nLiteralization \n(Paraphrase)\n \u0645\u0632\u064a\n \u064a\u0633\u0627\u0631 \u0634\u0644\u0643\u0627\u062a\n\u0645\u0647\u0644\u0648\u0637 \u0635\u0644\u062e ...\nDude, don\u2019t eat my \nhead ... bring them out.\nThen give it up \nalready!\n10\n \u0644\u0643 \u0634\u0645\n \u0644\u0643\u0627\u062a\u064a\u0628 \u0631\u064a\u0637\n\u0647\u0645\u062d\u0644\nNot every bird gets its \nmeat eaten...\nShe\u2019s not the one \nto mess with.\n11 \u062a\u0633\u0628\u0643\n\u0647\u062f\u062d\u0648 \u0647\u0631\u0645\nIt rained heavily at \nonce\nThis fucking \nrain.\n12 \u0644\u0642\u0639\u0627\n... \u062d \u0651\u0648\u0631\u0648Be smart and go away...

Similarly, the subtitles of these expressions and phrases also relay the idiomatic \nmeaning in an understandable and memorable way.\nThe source text in example (1) is a commonly used Jordanian proverb, which means that what is \ndiscussed overtly in social chat groups is a lot less than what is kept covert. The target text creatively captures \nthe idea that rumors and stories are superficial and lack depth. Example (2) is also an idiomatic expression \nResearch Journal in Advanced Humanities\nPage 167\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\nthat centers around exploiting someone or something, using the verbs \u2018milking or squeezing.\u2019 The subtitler \ncunningly uses an English idiom with a close meaning (capitalizing from small investments). Example (3) is \na proverb that stresses keeping secrets among partners, which is skillfully associated with burial in the target \ntext. Example (4) is a proverb that explains rumor-spreading mechanisms in social circles. The subtitler used \nan English idiom that matches the rapidity of a wildfire\u2019s propagation to the rapid spread of information. \nExample (5) explains how someone becomes unemployed or a bum. The target text, however, comes with \nan added touch of insensitivity, emphasizing the person\u2019s lack of worth. All these examples are creatively \nrendered using \u2018idiom to idiom\u2019 or \u2018metaphorical approximation\u2019 strategy. They are accurately rendered in a \nway that captures the meaning and relays the message of the original idiom, i.e., content and form.\n A similar strategy, Metaphorization, is used for rendering examples (6-8), which are also common \nidioms in Jordanian Arabic. Example (6) is a kind of threat by the speaker, a metaphor that has the sense \nof an addressee getting involved in a difficult situation without proper awareness of its consequences. The \nsource text is rendered into a stronger English idiom that sounds more intimidating. Example (7) is a \nJordanian idiomatic expression whose meaning is context-dependent. It could mean \u2018to pay someone off,\u2019 \n\u2018to enhance the quality of a product or service given to a specific person.\u2019 or \u2018to make something or someone \n(prostitutes) look nice\u2019 (or more attractive) as in the context of The Alleys. The subtitler does a great job \nusing the English idiom with the word \u2018doll,\u2019 which more than captures the sense of the original. Finally, \nexample (8) is a suggestion to end an activity or event early. The target text employs a metaphor that \nsuggests exactly the same. For these expressions, the subtitler opted for metaphorization, i.e., transferring \nthe content or message of the source text, which, albeit with different linguistic elements, creates an effect \nin the target text audience similar to that created by the source text.\nHowever, with examples (9-13), literalization (paraphrase) is used as an attempt to capture the cultural \nsubtleties embedded in the Arabic idioms. Example (9) shows the speaker\u2019s annoyance at somebody who is \nreluctant to give something up. The idiomatic phrase \u2018Don\u2019t eat my head\u2019 means \u2018Don\u2019t annoy me and give it \nup,\u2019 which is exactly what the target text states but in a more succinct and literal manner, thus ensuring that \nthe message gets across. Example (10) is a metaphor that cautions against underestimating someone\u2019s power. \nThe target text is a literal rendition, but it transfers the effect of the message. The same applies to examples \n(11-13), which are also translated literally, and they create effects that are similar to those intended by the \nsource texts, i.e., the emotional conceptualization of the abruptness and intensity of the rain (example 11), \nthe intensity of the command to leave (example 12) and maintaining the informal tone of a more direct and \nassertive response (example 13).\nTerms of address\nTerms of address, according to Oyetade (1995, p. 515), are \u201cwords or expressions used to designate \nthe person being talked to while talk is in progress.\u201d In English, for example, these are words like you, \nmom, young man, or Professor Snyder.\u201d These culture-bound expressions should be carefully handled in \ntranslation and subtitling in order to ensure an engaging and relatable reading/ watching experience. When \nadapting terms of address in subtitling and in order to accurately convey the appropriate emotions and \nrelationships between characters, it is important to consider the cultural context, politeness levels, and tone \nof the conversation (Table 3).\nResearch Journal in Advanced Humanities\nPage 168\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\nTable 3\n Examples of terms of address as used in the movie\nTheme\n#\nStrategy\nSource Text\nLiteral Translation\nTarget Text\nTerms of \nAddress\n14\nCultural Ad-\naptation\n-  \u062a\u0646\u0628 \u0627\u064a\n \u064a\u0644\u064a\u0645\u0631\u0627 \u0633\u0627\u0646\u0644\u0627\n\u062d\u0627\u062a\u0641\u0645\u0644\u0627\u0647\n\u200f-  \u062a\u0646\u0627\n \u0627\u0647\u064a\u0641 \u062a\u064a\u0644\u062e\n\u0633\u0627\u0646 \u062a\u0646\u0628\nHey, daughter of the \npeople, hand me this \nkey.\nDid you leave any \ndaughter in it?\n- Open this door, \nwoman!\n- Don\u2019t you \n\u201cwoman\u201d me!\n15\nCultural Ad-\naptation\n \u062c\u0627\u062d\u0644\u0627\u0648\n \u0647\u062a\u0644\u0626\u0633\u0627 \u00bb\u0631\u0645\u0639\u00ab\n\u2026\u0629\u0631\u064a\u062b\u0643\nAnd Haj Omar, his \nquestions are so many \n...\nThat old man \nkept asking me \nquestions\n16\nDeletion \u0627 \u064b\u0628\u062d\u0631\u0645\n\u201d\u0644\u064a\u0633\u0623\u201c \u062a\u0633Hello, Ms. Aseel.\n- Hello, Aseel, \nhow are you?\n17\nSubstitution \u0627\u0628\u062d\u0631\u0645\n ... \u064a\u062a\u0646\u0622\n\u061f\u061f\u0643\u0641\u064a\u0643\nHello Auntie ...

Did you leave any daughter in it?\u2019) is usually used in \nJordanian Arabic by an angry person in order to avoid swearing. The target text skillfully achieves cultural \napproximation by employing direct and strong language that captures the assertive tone of the speaker and \nconveys the same connotations as the source text. The use of \u201cwoman\u201d in the imperative form retains the \nfamiliarity and intensity of the source. The same applies to the response \u2018Don\u2019t you woman me,\u2019 which also \nachieves a similar degree of linguistic strength.\nExamples (15-17) include honorifics that convey politeness and respect, as in (15), and warmth and \nfamiliarity, as in (16 & 17). Avoiding literal translation, these terms are rendered idiomatically in a way \nthat maintains the same contexts. In (15), \u2018old man\u2019 replaces \u2018Haj\u2019 to uphold the same level of politeness \nand to account for cultural sensitivity. However, the Arabic term \u2018Haj\u2019 literally means \u201cpilgrim,\u201d which is \nderived from the verb \u201c( \u201d\u062c\u062dhajja), meaning \u201cmade a pilgrimage to Mecca.\u201d It is used in Muslim societies as \na term of address to respectfully refer to elderly men, who are usually given priority to perform pilgrimage. \nTranslating \u2018Haj\u2019 as \u2018Old man\u2019 captures the honorific angel of the term, but it definitely leaves out the \nreligious aspect.\nIn (16 & 17), \u2018Aseel\u2019 replaces \u2018Ms. Aseel\u2019 to provide a more casual translation, thus enhancing the \nconversational flow, and \u2018my dear\u2019 replaces \u2018Auntie\u2019 to provide a friendly greeting and inquiry about well-\nbeing.\nResearch Journal in Advanced Humanities\nPage 169\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\nReligious Expressions\nTable 4 includes instances where religious expressions are translated while considering the context, cultural \nsensitivity, and emotional nuances.\nTable 4\nExamples of religion-based expressions as used in the movie.\nTheme\n#\nStrategy\nSource Text\nLiteral Trans-\nlation\nTarget Text\nReligious Ex-\npressions\n18\nCultural Adapta-\ntion\n-!!!\u0647\u0644\u0644\u0627 \u064a\u062f\u062d\u0648\n\u200f- !! \u0647\u0644\u0644\u0627 \u062f\u062d\u0648\nSay God is \none!!!

Similarly, the source text in example (19), an Islamic expression used in times of \ndistress or difficulty, is replaced with a common English phrase that conveys surprise or astonishment, \naiming to capture the emotional aspect of the Arabic phrase, which does not directly carry the religious load \nof that phrase. Moreover, example (20) is an Arabic exchange, offering condolence and expressing comfort \nto someone who has experienced a loss. The religious source text is replaced with culturally appropriate \nphrases that carry the same emotional load. These renditions, however, are at the expense of the religious \ncontent of the source texts as the target texts deviate significantly from the source text, leaving out its \nreligious aspect. Such deviations may lead to misunderstandings of the dialogue, which highlights the \ncultural and contextual awareness when translating religious expressions. \nResearch Journal in Advanced Humanities\nPage 170\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\nOaths\nLike other languages, Arabic has a variety of idiomatic expressions for emphasizing oaths and commitments \n(Table 5).\nTable 5\n Examples of oaths as used in the movie\nTheme\n#\nStrategy\nSource Text\nLiteral Translation\nTarget Text\nOaths\n21\nIdiom to \nidiom\n \u064a\u0648\u0628\u0627 \u0629\u0645\u062d\u0631\u0648\n... \u0643\u0637\u0642\u0644\u0627 \u062d\u0631\nAnd by my father\u2019s \nsoul, I\u2019ll catch \nyou!!!\nI swear on my fa-\nther\u2019s grave I\u2019ll find \nyou \u2026\n22\nIdiom to \nidiom\n \u064a\u0645\u0623 \u0636\u0631\u0639\u0648\u200f\n \u0629\u0637\u0644\u062e\u0644\u0627 \u062a\u064a\u0634\u0645\n.\u0643\u062f\u0628 \u0627\u0645 \u064a\u0632\nBy my mother\u2019s \nhonor, the hustle \ntook place as you \nwished. \nOn my mother\u2019s \nsoul, that hustle \nworked like a \ncharm\nThe examples in Table (5) show commonly used Arabic informal phrases that speakers employ as \noaths to affirm a strong commitment or promise by invoking the memory and honor of a loved one, as \nshown by examples (21 & 22), respectively. \nThe target texts in examples (21 & 22) maintain the essence and solemn nature of the oaths by \nreferring to the father\u2019s grave and the mother\u2019s honor. These oaths emphasize the seriousness and gravity \nof the speaker\u2019s statement and commitment using idiomatic expressions that retain the cultural load. When \ntranslating these oaths into English, the emotional and cultural aspects of these expressions must be carefully \ntaken into account in order to maintain the oath\u2019s meaning and impact in the target texts.\nFood & Drinks\nTerms related to food and drinks are among the culture-bound expressions. Translating them across \nlanguages requires careful consideration to ensure that the target text is comprehensible and relatable to \nthe target audience. This sometimes means having to replace these cultural references with target language \nexpressions that are accurately received by the target audience (Table 6). \nTable 6\n Examples of names of food and drinks as used in the movie.\nTheme\n#\nStrategy\nSource \nText\nLiteral Transla-\ntion\nTarget Text\nFood & \nDrinks\n23\nCultural Adapta-\ntion\n \u062f\u0639\u0628\u0648\n...\u0629\u062f\u0627\u0633\u0644\u0627 \u0646\u0627\u062c\u0646\u0641\nAnd after the \nsugar-free coffee \n...\nBut after drinking to \nthe agreement\u2026\n24\nGeneralization \u0643\u0644\u0628\u062c\u0628\n \u0631\u062f\u0633 \u0649\u0644\u0639 \u0647\u0627\u064a\u0625\n\u0629\u0641\u0627\u0646\u0643\nI\u2019ll bring him to \nyou on a large \nplate of Kona-\nfah.\nI\u2019ll whip him up into \na dessert for you.\nThe source text in example (23) signals the end of a gathering or a banquette, after which Arabian \ncoffee is usually served. Arabian coffee is usually served on different occasions and for different purposes, \none of which is to signal consent to a request. The literal translation of the expression may convey the \nsemantic content, but the function may not be correctly perceived by the target audience. While Arabian \ncoffee is served to conclude an agreement or to grant a request, it is not the beverage served on such \noccasions in English-speaking societies. Rather, in Western societies, alcoholic drinks are served, and people \nResearch Journal in Advanced Humanities\nPage 171\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\u2018drink to the agreement.\u2019 This cultural adaptation efficiently carries the notion of concluding a social or \nbusiness gathering while adapting to the cultural context of the target language.\nThe same applies to example (24), where \u2018Konafah,\u2019 a popular Middle Eastern dessert made of \npastry and syrup, is substituted with \u2018dessert\u2019 in the target text to achieve comprehension. \u2018Konafah\u2019 is used \nmetaphorically in the source text, which means literal translation may not capture its figurative meaning. \nTherefore, the target text employs a different generalization strategy by reimagining the metaphor and \nexpressing it more directly as \u201cI\u2019ll whip him up into a dessert for you.\u201d This adaptation effectively retains the \nessence of offering something (or someone) to someone but substitutes the cultural reference with a more \nuniversally understandable concept. This approach allows for a smoother comprehension of the metaphor, \nespecially for those unfamiliar with the original cultural reference. By using a universally understood concept \nlike dessert, the subtitler ensures that the message will resonate with a wider audience and facilitate better \ncommunication. The translation strategies in both examples aim at maintaining the meaning and cultural \nnuances of the source text while adapting them to the target language and culture. \nSwear Words \nTranslation becomes more challenging when translating swear words, as they often carry deep cultural \nand historical connotations that may not have direct equivalents in the target language. Translators must \nnavigate the complexities of each language\u2019s unique expressions of profanity, ensuring that the translated \ntext conveys the intended level of offense or vulgarity without losing its cultural significance.\u00a0Therefore, a \nsuccessful translation must go beyond semantic transfer in order to reflect the intended offense, emotional \neffect, and cultural context of the source text.\nAs shown in Table (7), the literal translations of the source texts successfully convey the meaning \nof the swear words, but the intended emotional damage is not equally achieved in the target texts due to \ncultural differences. The subtitler, therefore, utilized a set of strategies in his rendering of these offensive \nterms to accomplish not only semantic transfer but also to account for cultural isomorphism and to ensure \nthat the emotional impact is reproduced in the target texts. These strategies include substitution (or cultural \nadaptation), deletion, literal translation, and addition. The examples in Table (7) are categorized according \nto the theme of offensive language. These include swear words that are related to relatives, rudeness and \ndisrespect, animals, and excretion. \nOne of the most prominent cultural differences between Arabic and English cultures is that, in Arab \ncultures, relative-related offensive language is primarily directed at the addressee\u2019s sister and less frequently \nat the mother, father, and other family members. The addressee\u2019s female relatives in Arab cultures are usually \ntargeted by swear words, which makes a common pattern in these cultures. The mother, on the other \nhand, is more frequently targeted by swear words in English-speaking cultures. Therefore, to ensure that \nthe tone and impact of the source text are effectively conveyed when translating swear words and insults, \nit is essential to consider cultural sensitivities and the target audience\u2019s expectations. This often requires \ndeparting from literal translation.\nThis is evident in examples 1-5 (Table 7), where the derogatory language in the source texts is directed \nat the addressees\u2019 sisters. \nResearch Journal in Advanced Humanities\nPage 172\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\nTable 7\nExamples of swear words as used in the movie.\nTheme\n#\nStrategy\nSource Text Literal Translation\nTarget Text\nRelative \nRelated\n1\nSubstitution \u0648\u062e\u0623 \u0627\u064a \u0639\u0645\u0633\u0627\n\u2026\u0629\u0637\u0648\u0645\u0631\u0634\u0644\u0627Listen, bitch\u2019s brother...\nListen, you son of \na bitch.\n2\nSubstitution \u0641\u0631\u0627\u0639 \u0634\u0645 \u0647\u062a\u0646\u0627\n \u0627\u064a \u062a\u0639\u0642\u0648 \u0646\u064a\u0645 \u0639\u0645\n\u0629\u0637\u0648\u0645\u0631\u0634\u0644\u0627 \u0648\u062e\u0627\nYou don\u2019t know who you \nfell with, brother of a \nbitch.\nYou\u2019re digging \nyourself a deep \nhole, you son of a \nbitch.\n3\nDeletion & Sub-\nstitution\n \u0648\u062e\u0623 \u0643\u062a\u062e\u0623 \u0633\u0643\n \u0643\u0644\u0648 \u0629\u0637\u0648\u0645\u0631\u0634\u0644\u0627\n\u064a\u0627\u0647 \u064a\u062a\u0646\u0628\nYour sister\u2019s pussy \u2026 \nbitch\u2019s brother \u2026 This my \ndaughter!!\nThat\u2019s my daugh-\nter, you son of a \nbitch.\n4\nSubstitution \u0639\u0642\u0648\u062a \u0627\u0645 \u0644\u0643\u0648\n \u060c\u0629\u0628\u062d\u0642 \u0648\u062e\u0623 \u062f\u0646\u0639\n  \u0651\u0646\u0633\u0644\u0627\u0639 \u0627\u0647\u0643\u0644\u0639\u0628\n.\u0647\u062d\u064a\u0631\u0628 \u064a\u0644\u0644\u0627\nAnd every time it lands \nwith a brother of a pros-\ntitute, he chews it on the \ntooth that makes him feel \nwell.\nThen every son \nof a bitch has his \nway with it.\n5\nSubstitution \u0648\u062e\u0627 \u0627\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0648\n \u0637\u064a\u0645\u0627\u0631\u0634\u0644\u0627\n \u0627\u0644\u0648 \u062a\u0646\u0627 \u062a\u0639\u0644\u0637\n\u061f\u061f\u0643\u064a\u0646\u0645 \u0627\u064a\nYou brother of sluts \u2026 it\u2019s \nyou?

The target texts, however, show a cultural difference \nemerging from the subtitler\u2019s utilization of the substitution strategy. The target of all the insults in these \nexamples shifts from the sister to the mother of the addressee, which creates a cultural context that is \nrelatable and more familiar to the target audience. Even the second expletive in example (5), \u2018you fagot,\u2019 \nis redirected from the addressee himself to his mother. Example (6), on the other hand, is an instance of \ncultural adaptation, where the expletive \u2018the fuck\u2019 is used as an emphatic slot filler to use Ljung\u2019s (2011) \ntaxonomy. While the swear word in example (7) is deleted, the expletive in example (8) is the only instance \nof literal translation where the form and content are maintained in the target text.\nArabic insults directed at the addressee\u2019s mother are also common in Arabic-speaking cultures but \nless frequent in the movie dialogue. Examples (9-12) in Table 7 show a variety of such swear words, some \nof which have equivalents in English, while others do not. Examples (9 & 10) easily translate into similar \nEnglish phrases that carry the same emotional load and achieve the same level of offense, adapting at the \nsame time to the cultural context. Examples (11&12), on the other hand, show how cultural differences \nimpose cultural adaptation in the rendering of derogatory language. The source texts in these two examples \ncontain offensive language involving the addressee\u2019s mother, which the subtitler effectively replaces with the \nResearch Journal in Advanced Humanities\nPage 174\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\ncommon expletive \u2018son of a bitch,\u2019 maintaining their offensive tone and intensity and adapting them to the \nEnglish language and cultural norms.\nIn the second category, Rudeness and Disrespect, only one example (20) is translated literally. This \nis because the phrase is a common insult in Jordanian Arabic and has a formal equivalent in English. \nTherefore, literal translation achieves both the semantic transfer and the intended insult. However, this \nstrategy does not work with the other examples where substitution or cultural adaptation is employed, as \nexamples (13-15) show. The expletives (worthless father, asshole, and get the fuck out, respectively) in the \ntarget texts are even dysphemizing and more insulting to the referents and addressees. Example (16), on the \nother hand, includes a form of cultural adaptation since the literal translation might be inappropriate and \nracial due to the expression\u2019s historical association with forms of address used with African Americans in \nthe US. Nevertheless, the intended ridiculing sense of the expression \u2018wala\u2019 (boy) is lost here, but the insult \nis delivered.\nDeletion is employed in the examples (17-19) in Table (7). The deleted expressions are used both as \ninsults and forms of endearment in Jordanian Arabic. Deleting them does not significantly impact the overall \ncomprehension of the dialogue, but translating them idiomatically may reveal the kind of relationship \nbetween speakers and addressees. The source expressions in examples (17&18) are said as endearment, \nwhile in (19), the subtitler toned down the utterance by deleting the phrase \u2018beat it or fuck off\u2019, which could \nhave been more effective since it is coming from a gang leader to an inferior gang member. \nIn the category \u2018Animal Related Swearwords,\u2019 only two examples are found in the extracted data. The \nexpressions used are \u2018dog\u2019 in example (21), and \u2018animal\u2019 in example (22). Both words are insulting in Arab \ncultures, as well as in English cultures. The subtitler chose to delete the word \u2018dog\u2019 in example (21) and to \nlimit the insult to the other swearword in the utterance (scumbag), which he substituted with (bastard). The \nword \u2018animal\u2019 in example (22) is substituted with \u2018scumbag\u2019, which is more insulting to the referent in the \ntarget culture. Literal translation here (i.e., \u2018animal\u2019) may not convey the same amount of disrespect because \nthis word is commonly used in English in competition contexts as praise and an indication of physical \nstrength. This is, we believe, an appropriate cultural adaptation. The same is done with the last example (23) \nin Table (7). The source text expression meaning \u2018shit\u2019 is substituted with the expletive \u2018fucking.\u2019 Although \nliteral translation could have conveyed the same amount of vulgarity, the target text expression is more \nculturally adaptive.\nTable (7) presents various ways in which rude and disrespectful language can be expressed through \nsubstitutions, additions, deletions, and literal translations. The choice of words and expressions significantly \naffects the level of disrespect conveyed, ranging from milder forms of irritation to stronger derogatory \nlanguage. These examples highlight the importance of understanding the cultural and contextual nuances of \nlanguage to accurately convey the intended tone and meaning.\nTable 7 shows how rude and disrespectful language can be translated by utilizing a variety of \ntranslation strategies, such as substitution, addition, deletion, or literal translation. The level of vulgarity \nand disrespect conveyed can vary depending on the choice of words and expressions, from mild irritation \nto strong derogatory language. These examples underscore the significance of evaluating the cultural and \ncontextual meanings of swearwords in order to accurately communicate the intended message and the \namount of emotional impact. \nConclusions\nThe examples extracted from the subtitle of The Alleys demonstrate how language can be creatively adapted \nto capture cultural context, emotions, and underlying meanings. The target texts often rely on metaphors, \ndirectness, and intensity to convey the essence of the original expressions. The translation choices reflect the \nintention to make the meaning clear and emotionally resonant in the target language. The analysis of these \nidioms and proverbs shows that translation isn\u2019t just about word-to-word correspondence but rather about \ncapturing the essence, cultural context, and emotional nuances of the original expressions. The target texts \nResearch Journal in Advanced Humanities\nPage 175\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\noften creatively adapt the source expressions to convey similar meanings and emotions in English.\nTo delve into the intricate realm of English subtitles for Arabic films, The Alleys on the Netflix \nplatform was chosen as a focal point. We encountered a multitude of challenges throughout our research, \nspanning from linguistic subtleties to cultural sensitivities. In addition, we reflected on several strategies and \nmethodologies that aimed at enhancing the quality and effectiveness of English subtitles for Arabic content \non Netflix, offering solutions to address these encountered challenges.\nThe study findings hold significance for various domains, including content accessibility, cross-cultural \ncommunication, and audiovisual translation. It remains crucial to guarantee that subtitles effectively convey \nthe intended message while maintaining the cultural richness of the source material, especially as streaming \nservices are expanding to reach wider global audiences. Our recommendations emphasize the importance \nof collaborative efforts involving translators, filmmakers, and streaming platforms to deliver subtitles that \nresonate with English-speaking viewers without compromising the essence of the original content. Moreover, \nour study underscores the ongoing need for research and education in the field of audiovisual translation, \nequipping professionals with the requisite skills and expertise for this challenging undertaking.\nFinally, the rather successful English subtitle of The Alleys on the Netflix platform augments the \nstreaming experience for viewers while testifying to the value of translation in bridging cultural gaps and \nadvancing intercultural communication. It is hoped that the knowledge and suggestions presented in this \nstudy will help to develop Arabic-English subtitle techniques, \nFinally, the relatively \u201csuccessful\u201d English subtitling of The Alleys on Netflix augments the streaming \nexperience for viewers while also serving as a testament to the value of translation in overcoming cultural \ndivides and promoting intercultural understanding. It is our aim that the knowledge and suggestions offered \nin this paper may help to advance Arabic-to-English subtitle techniques, enhancing the accessibility and \nenjoyment of a wide range of cinematic content for viewers all around the world.\nFunding: This research received no external funding.\nConflicts of Interest: The authors declare no conflict of interest. \nResearch Journal in Advanced Humanities\nPage 176\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\nReferences\nAbdelaal, N.

Haider\n2,3 & Amer Al-Adwan\n4\u2709\nThis study adopts a corpus-assisted approach to explore the translation strategies that\nNet\ufb02ix subtitlers opted for in rendering 1564 English swear words into Arabic. It uses a\n699,229-word English-Arabic parallel corpus consisting of the English transcriptions of forty\nEnglish movies, drama, action, science \ufb01ction (sci-\ufb01), and biography and their Arabic sub-\ntitles. Using the wordlist tool in SketchEngine, the researchers identi\ufb01ed some frequent swear\nwords, namely fuck, shit, damn, ass, bitch, bastard, asshole, dick, cunt, and pussy. Moreover,\nusing the parallel concordance tool in SketchEngine revealed that three translation strategies\nwere observed in the corpus, namely, omission, softening, and swear-to-non-swear. The\nomission strategy accounted for the lion\u2019s share in the investigated data, with 66% for drama,\n61% for action, 52% for biography, and 40% for sci-\ufb01. On the other hand, the swear-to-non-\nswear strategy was the least adopted one, accounting for 21% in sci-\ufb01, 16% in biography, 14%\nin drama, and 11% in action. In addition, the softening strategy got the second-highest\nfrequency across the different movie genres, with 39% for sci-\ufb01, 32% for biography, 28% for\naction, and 20% for drama. Since swear words have connotative functions, omitting or\neuphemizing them could cause a slight change in the representation of meaning and char-\nacters. The study recommends more corpus-assisted studies on different AVT modes,\nincluding dubbing, voiceover, and free commentaries.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-01506-3\nOPEN\n1 Kent State University, Kent, OH, USA. 2 Applied Science Private University, Amman 11192, Jordan. 3 MEU Research Unit, Middle East University,\nAmman, Jordan. 4 Hamad Bin Khalifa University, Ar-Rayyan, Qatar. \u2709email: aadwan@hbku.edu.qa\nHUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS |  (2023) 10:39 | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-01506-3\n1\n1234567890():,;\nIntroduction\nA\nudiovisual translation (AVT) or multimedia translation\nplays an essential role in our lives due to the enormous\nvolume of audiovisual materials that can be accessed\nthrough various media and entertainment platforms. AVT has\naroused the interest of researchers because it represents a fertile\nenvironment for those interested in examining how the linguistic\nand non-linguistic components of the AV product are trans-\nmitted to the audience. Au (2009) de\ufb01ned AVT as a discipline\nthat encompasses a transfer of verbal and non-verbal aspects of\naudiovisual products, making it a multi-semiotic translation.\nSubtitling can be considered the most extensively researched\nmode of AV modes. The two most popular forms in AVT are\ndubbing and subtitling. Chaume (2020, p. 1) de\ufb01ned dubbing as a\ntype of AVT that \u201cconsists of replacing the original track of a\n\ufb01lm\u2019s (or any audiovisual text) source language dialogs with\nanother track on which translated dialogs have been recorded in\nthe target language.\u201d According to Karamitroglou (2000, p. 5),\nsubtitling is \u201cthe translation of the spoken (or written) source text\nof an audiovisual product into a written target text which is added\nonto the images of the original product, usually at the bottom of\nthe screen.\u201d D\u00edaz-Cintas and Remael (2014) classi\ufb01ed subtitles\ninto three linguistic dimensions: intralingual, interlingual, and\nbilingual. This study scrutinizss a paralel interlingual corpus of\nforty English movies along with their Arabic subtitles.\nThis study combines corpus linguistics and translation studies in\nwhat is known as corpus-assisted translation studies. With the\nadvent of personal computers, the initial motive for using corpus\nlinguistics in translation was in the 1990s (Baker, 1993). Corpus-\nbased translation studies involve \u201cthe use of corpus linguistic\ntechnologies to inform and elucidate the translation process\u201d\n(Kruger et al., 2011). The translation process is investigated\nthrough specialized software explicitly designed to search for par-\nticular keywords. The software, in turn, gives statistics and com-\nparisons that help obtain analytical results for the original text and\nits translations. Examples of software packages include WordSmith\n(Scott, 2012), AntConc (Anthony, 2013), and SketchEngine (Kil-\ngarriff et al., 2014).\nThis study adopts a corpus-assisted approach to explore the\nmost frequent translation strategies that professional subtitlers\nopted for when rendering English swear words into Arabic. It\nexamines the subtitling of English movies into Arabic by investi-\ngating the subtitles of swear words in forty movies in four different\ngenres, namely drama, action, sci-\ufb01, and biography. Swear words\nexpress the speaker\u2019s sentiments and reactions in an impolite\nmanner (Moore, 2012). Various genres, such as drama, action, and\ncomedy, to mention a few, include different swear words that are\nused to convey different messages. The translation of swear words\nis a subject of contention among translators and researchers,\nespecially when dealing with different languages and cultures.\nGiven that rendering swear words is a demanding task requiring\na set of translation strategies, subtitlers need to know how to render\nthe message to the target culture appropriately. This study attempts\nto answer the following two research questions:\n1. What are the most commonly adopted translation strategies\nby Net\ufb02ix subtitlers in rendering English swear words into\nArabic?\n2. How were the translation strategies distributed in the four\ninvestigated genres, namely drama, action, sci-\ufb01, and\nbiography?\nLiterature review\nGottlieb (2001, p. 87) de\ufb01ned subtitling as \u201cthe rendering in a\ndifferent language of verbal messages in \ufb01lmic media in the\nshape of one or more lines of written text presented on the\nscreen in sync with the original message.\u201d Subtitling could be\ndone\nby\nprofessional\ntranslators\n(subtitlers)\nand\nnon-\nprofessional translators (fansubbers). D\u00edaz-Cintas and Mu\u00f1oz\nS\u00e1nchez (2006) de\ufb01ned fansubs as a form of subtitles executed\nby non-professional translators. According to O\u2019Hagan (2007, p.\n162), professional subtitling is the \u201conly commercially viable\nway to ef\ufb01ciently produce subtitles in a wide range of languages\nwith limited time and budget.\u201d Fansubbers are aware that they\nare translating for an audience with a greater interest in the\n\ufb01lm\u2019s original culture than the casual viewer (D\u00edaz-Cintas and\nMu\u00f1oz S\u00e1nchez, 2006). Consequently, fansubbers often prior-\nitize strategies that\nprovide viewers\nwith an \u201cauthentic\u201d\nexperience (O\u2019Hagan, 2007).\nThis study investigates the translation strategies used to render\nswear words. The researchers hypothesize that omission will be\nthe most used strategy by Net\ufb02ix subtitlers. This could be due to\nsome issues related to culture and censorship.\nSwearing. There is a lack of agreement when attempting to cir-\ncumscribe what constitutes swear words from a linguistic per-\nspective (O\u2019Driscoll, 2020). Nodoushan (2016, p. 241) argued that\n\u201cswear word/cursing, poor language, and \ufb01lthy language\u201d can be\nused interchangeably. Likewise, Vingerhoets et al. (2013) pointed\nout that swearing and cursing are synonyms. Furthermore, in\nStapleton (2010) de\ufb01nition, expletives and swear words are\nsynonymous, which is consistent with Ljung (2011) observation\nthat expletives are the prototype of the use of swear words by\nmost people.\nThe de\ufb01nitions of swearing vary depending on its linguistic,\nsocial, and psychological functions. For example, Dewaele (2004)\nargued that swear and taboo words are multifunctional and\npragmatic units that take diverse discourse functions and are\nidenti\ufb01ed by their offensiveness. Linguistically speaking, Ljung\n(2011) de\ufb01ned swearing as the use of utterances comprising\nprohibited words, typically subject to severe lexical, phrasal, and\nsyntactic constraints, implying formulaic language and having a\nprimarily emotional purpose. Furthermore, some conceptual and\nfunctional overlap exists between swearing and other forms of\ntaboo language, such as slurs and discriminatory language (Allan,\n2015; O\u2019Driscoll, 2020). Therefore, the efforts at de\ufb01ning,\ndelimiting, and typologizing swear words are united by the fact\nthat they index the perspective of their function.\nO\u2019Driscoll\n(2020)\nemphasized\none\ncritical\ndistinguishing\nelement of swear words, which is related to the potential for\nsuch words to be offensive and elicit negative emotions. Swearing\nis, therefore, by nature, a taboo action. As a result, it is often\nsocially sanctioned or penalized through various informal and\nformal mechanisms (Stapleton et al., 2022). In addition, Stapleton\n(2010) hypothesized that swearing serves speci\ufb01c objectives that\nare dif\ufb01cult to perform through other types of language use.\nTherefore, swearing creates various unique psychological, phy-\nsiological, and emotional effects and has interactional and\nrhetorical outcomes (Stapleton et al., 2022).\nSwearing is regarded as inappropriate use of language.\nAndersson and Trudgill (1992) identi\ufb01ed three motives for\nswearing: linguistic, social, and psychological. Swearing is a\nlinguistic activity that involves the use of taboo words (Stapleton,\n2010). Therefore, it is a topic that lends itself to investigation\nfrom various linguistic perspectives, including psycholinguistics\n(Pinker, 2007), pragmatics (Jay and Janschewitz, 2008), socio-\nlinguistics (Hagen, 2013), and semantics (Goddard, 2015).\nAndersson and Trudgill (1992) de\ufb01ned swearing as language\nuse in which the expression relates to something stigmatized in\nARTICLE\nHUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-01506-3\n2\nHUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS |  (2023) 10:39 | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-01506-3\nthe swearer\u2019s culture is not intended to be rendered literally, and\ncan be used to convey some emotions or meanings. Swearing is\noften associated with references to sexuality, genitalia, and\nreligion (Pinker, 2007; Stapleton, 2010).\nAccording to Montagu (2001, p. 71), swearing is \u201ca learned\nform of human behavior in cultures and under conditions in\nwhich it is encouraged.\u201d Social interaction may offer more\nfundamental insights into the emergence of swearing than solely\nattributing it to linguistic causes (Song et al., 2022). Research\ninterest is now being paid to the study of swearing from a\npsychological perspective since it reveals answers to fundamental\nquestions such as, \u201cWhy do we swear?\u201d Is there a connection\nbetween exposure to positive and negative attitudes and the use of\nswearing? The investigation of swearing from psychological,\nsocial, and linguistic perspectives becomes considerably more\napproachable once these questions are answered. According to\nJay (2009), swearing is not an indication of low intellect and\ninarticulacy, as is often assumed, but rather an emotional\nlanguage. Thereby, the correlation between swearing and emotion\nstrengthens the psychological impact of cursing.\nMulti-functionality of Swear words (Denotative vs. Con-\nnotative Meaning). Semantics is the study of language meaning.\nIt has two kinds of meaning, namely denotative and connotative.\nAs stated by Crane et al. (1981), denotative meaning is the aspect\nof a word or phrase meaning that is akin to a de\ufb01nition. Likewise,\nOmar (2012) argued that a word\u2019s or lexeme\u2019s denotation is its\nessential meaning as de\ufb01ned in a dictionary. While the con-\nnotative meaning is related to psychology and culture and refers\nto the personal or emotional associations aroused by words. In\naddition to its literal meaning, a word\u2019s connotation may convey\nnuanced emotions and judgments. Generally speaking, one may\ninfer that the denotative meaning is the same as the literal dic-\ntionary meaning, but the connotative meaning is a culturally\ndependent meaning (non-literal).\nIn the context of swear words, there is a debate in the literature\nabout whether or not swear words can be used denotatively or\nliterally (Andersson and Trudgill, 1992; Dynel, 2012; Ljung, 2011;\nPinker, 2007). For example, Singleton (2009) offered a triple set of\nrequired criteria for swear words: they link to taboo domains, can\nproduce catharsis, and have literal and non-literal meanings.\nFurthermore, O\u2019Driscoll (2020) argued that the issue is further\nprovoked by the fact that many of the seemingly most offensive\nEnglish taboo words are employed metaphorically than literally,\nso that taboo reference is not a factor but rather a form of taboo.\nTherefore, swear words, by their very de\ufb01nition and use, are\njudged to be offensive, regardless of whether the meaning in a\ngiven context is literal or non-literal, denotative or connotative\n(O\u2019Driscoll, 2020).\nEnglish and Arabic cultures. Language is intertwined with\nculture as it constitutes an authentic means of communication\ningrained in the core of reality, being the \u201csocially acquired\nknowledge\u201d (Yule, 2020, p. 267). Debbas and Haider (2020, p. 3)\nargued that \u201ccultural diversity is the source of translation, and\ntranslation is the outcome of cultural interchange.\u201d Translation\nis a communication tool that employs language and culture in\nthe service of each other. Ivarsson and Crofts (1992) pointed out\nthat it is vital to consider the language variety and cultural\nawareness of the intended audience while subtitling. Researchers\nhave argued that swear words have a signi\ufb01cant function in\nlanguage. In fact, they are often used when people need to vent\ntheir feelings and opinions, such as anger, surprise, or dis-\nsatisfaction (Jay, 1992). Swearing allows individuals to express\ntheir feelings through language, being a linguistic phenomenon\nworthy of in-depth investigation and analysis (see Chen, 2004;\nFern\u00e1ndez, 2009).\nSwear words are components of every language and culture\u2019s\nlexicon. Swear words are among the lexical items that are subject\nto social restrictions (Malenova, 2015). Manch\u00f3n (2013) claimed\nthat swear words might affect the \ufb02ow of a movie. Furthermore,\nsome researchers pointed out that the cultural and moral patterns\nof the target language may not allow translating swear words\nwhich are likely to alter throughout the translation process (see\nAmeri and Ghazizadeh, 2014; Sedighi and Najian, 2012).\nTherefore, translating swear words from one language/culture\ninto another may be problematic for subtitlers and put them\nunder the criticism of viewers, especially in conservative societies\n(Haider et al., 2023).\nSome audiovisual works produced in English are rife with\nswear words that may upset some target audiences, especially in\nconservative societies like the Arab ones. Alabbasi (2009) stated\nthat subtitling requires the adoption of what House (1977)\ntermed a cultural \ufb01lter. A Cultural \ufb01lter is a way to capture the\nsocial-cultural variations in behavioral norms and stylistic\nconventions between the source culture and the target culture,\nviewing the source text through the glasses of the target text\nmembers (House, 1977). Consequently, it attempts to naturalize\nthe source text to suit the features of the target cultures and texts.\nFurthermore, Alabbasi (2009) claimed that American movies, in\nparticular, are riddled with swear words in various situations,\nwhich Arab viewers may \ufb01nd repulsive and immoral, especially\nwhen such movies are viewed by the whole Arab family with\ndifferent\nage\ngroups.\nTherefore,\nAlabbasi\n(2009,\np.\n186)\nrecommended that \u201cswear words should be \ufb01ltered and translated\nwith words in the target language of the viewing audience which\nconvey the meaning of swear words (anger, hostility, justi\ufb01cation,\nfrustration, insult, scorning, or humiliation), not necessarily in\nthe same degree of vulgarity or offensiveness.\u201d\nSwearing is a taboo in languages subject to populist cultures\ngoverned by religions, traditions, and morals. Al-Yasin and\nRabab\u2019ah (2019) claimed that the Arab culture is well-known for\nits conservatism and in\ufb02uence of religion on society. Therefore,\nit is uncommon to hear a plain-spoken taboo word in the Arab\nmedia.\nAccording\nto\nAqel\n(2016),\nfour\nfactors\nmay\nbe\nconsidered when rendering English taboo words into Arabic\nmedia. These factors include culture, religion/beliefs, ideological\nperspectives, and the channel\u2019s policy. This shows that the\nreligious, cultural, and ideological aspects of the Arab society\nhave the upper hand when deciding which scenes and linguistic\nexpressions to appear and which ones to be weeded out. In this\nregard, Al-Adwan and Yahiaoui (2018, p. 87) argue that the\nEnglish and Arabic Languages \u201care culturally and linguistically\ndistant, and what might be accepted in the West might not be\ntolerated in the Arab World\u201d.\nModern standard Arabic (MSA) vs. Arabic vernaculars. The\nArabic language has different varieties, such as Jordanian,\nAlgerian, and Egyptian, in addition to Modern Standard Arabic\n(MSA), to mention a few. MSA is the variety used in the subtitling\nof audiovisual products (Al-Abbas and Haider, 2021). Arabs\nspeak different vernaculars that de\ufb01ne their identities within\nspeci\ufb01c geographical areas. At the same time, Modern Standard\nArabic (MSA) unites them, serving as a universally recognized\ncommunication medium among Arabs. Politeness is one of the\nmajor distinguishing characteristics of MSA when compared to\nspoken vernaculars. Vernaculars are often spoken but not written,\nwhich is why they are sometimes associated with impoliteness\n(Rabab\u2019ah and Alali, 2020). Vernacular Arabic also lacks the\nprestige of MSA and is often reserved for lowly functions\nHUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-01506-3\nARTICLE\nHUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS |  (2023) 10:39 | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-01506-3\n3\n(Suleiman, 1985). Therefore, it is not surprising that spoken\nArabic vernaculars have been demoted to serve as a medium for\nless prestigious functions, taboos, vulgarisms, and swearing. On\nthe other hand, MSA is a respected and cherished form that is\nseen as a mode of communication for polite and well-educated\nindividuals. This does not imply that MSA never uses impolite\nlanguage; nonetheless, the language used is often more polished\nand less offensive (Haider and Hussein, 2022).\nFarghal (1995) noted that euphemism as a pragmatic resource\nin natural language is associated with MSA rather than different\nArabic vernaculars since it is profoundly anchored in linguistic\npoliteness re\ufb02ected in careful speech. Dysphemism, on the other\nhand, is more prevalent in Arabic vernaculars than in MSA\n(Farghal, 1995). In the same vein, Haider and Hussein (2022, p. 3)\nclaimed that \u201cwords tend to be formal and polite in MSA, while\ntheir equivalents in colloquial lack this attribute.\u201d\nConsequently, in the case of subtitling swear words using MSA,\nthe target text would de\ufb01nitely be euphemized, mitigated, and\npolished. Accordingly, it would be dif\ufb01cult to maintain the same\nlevel of offensiveness that the swear words have in the source text.\nSwear words translation strategies. There are many strategies for\nrendering swear words and taboo expressions. Several researchers\nhave conducted studies on translating taboo expressions into\nArabic (see Al-Yasin and Rabab\u2019ah, 2019; Alsharhan, 2020;\nKrishan, 2012). Al-Yasin and Rabab\u2019ah (2019) examined the\nconnotative equivalence of taboo words in three American hip-\nhop movies and their Arabic subtitles. The \ufb01ndings indicated that\nthe Arab fan subtitler successfully rendered taboo words into\nArabic through euphemism and omission. These strategies are\nmainly employed to accommodate cultural constraints. The\nArabic subtitles conformed to the connotative functions of Eng-\nlish taboo words only when the translator utilized the euphemism\ntechnique. In contrast, the connotative functions failed to appear\nin the subtitles when the translator resorted to omission.\nAlmijrab (2020) proposed two main strategies for rendering\ntaboos into Arabic, namely substitution and taboo for taboo. The\nresearcher also highlighted that the translator might omit the\ntaboo word from the target text. However, the researcher also\nargued omission is not the right choice when the ST taboo is\ncrucial; therefore, the translator must adopt euphemism or\nsubstitution. In the same vein, Alsharhan (2020) examined the\nArabic subtitles generated by Net\ufb02ix, focusing on taboo language\ninstances. The \ufb01ndings indicated that two signi\ufb01cant modi\ufb01ca-\ntions to the existing subtitling strategies were required, namely\neuphemism and shift in the register. In addition, the results\nsuggested that a range of subtitling strategies were utilized in\nrendering taboo words into Arabic on Net\ufb02ix shows, contrary to\nprior norms, which often relied on omission and other forms of\neuphemism. Another signi\ufb01cant \ufb01nding was that approximately\nhalf of all taboo language instances are euphemized despite the\npolicy\u2019s non-censorship. Another study conducted by Debbas and\nHaider (2020) explored the cultural constraints inherent in the\nArabic subtitling of the American animated sitcom \u201cFamily Guy.\u201d\nThe researchers divided the cultural constraints encountered\nduring translation into three categories: religious remarks, jokes,\nand humor incorporating proper nouns and taboos. The \ufb01ndings\nindicated that religious remarks were rendered using scene\ndeletion, word omission, and word omission with justi\ufb01cations.\nAdditionally, the results showed that two strategies were used to\ntranslate taboos, namely euphemism, and omission. Finally, the\nresearch revealed that the target audience ideology and culture\nplay a crucial in determining the translation strategy to be used.\nAbdelaal and Al Sarhani (2021) investigated the strategies used\nin translating swear words from English into Arabic in the\n\u201cTraining Day\u201d movie and evaluated the subtitling quality. The\n\ufb01ndings showed that omission and euphemism are the most\ncommon strategies employed by the subtitlers. Furthermore, the\n\ufb01ndings revealed that the translation was of high quality.\nSimilarly, Al-Jabri et al. (2021) examined the strategies used by\nMBC 4 and Net\ufb02ix when rendering taboo terms from English to\nArabic. In contrast to video streaming services, the researchers\nassumed that Arabic satellite TV channels experience interven-\ntion from religious, political, and social authorities to preserve\ndecent material and censored language in their programs. The\nstudy\u2019s results suggested that the Arabic subtitles generated\nby the satellite Arabic TV channel mainly used euphemistic\nlanguage. This result is comparable to those made by some\nresearchers who indicated that omission is the most prevalent\nsubtitling strategy in translating swear words and taboos from\nEnglish into Arabic (Abdelaal and Al Sarhani, 2021; Al-Yasin and\nRabab\u2019ah, 2019; Almijrab, 2020; Debbas and Haider, 2020).\nThe present paper contributes to the previous literature on\nsubtitling swear words by investigating the strategies of subtitling\nEnglish swear words into Arabic in a large parallel corpus of\nmovies, which consists of forty movies. The study of the subtitling\nof swear words using a large corpus of movies will likely\ncontribute to the previous literature that investigated a relatively\nsmall amount of data. Given the fact that MSA is the Arabic\nvariety that appears on the screen in subtitling, the researchers\nargue that the degree of offensiveness of swearing will not be\nmaintained in the source text. The investigation of the different\nArabic renderings of English swear words may help translators\nand translation students acquaint themselves with the MSA\noptions that can be used to render swear words using different\ntranslation strategies.\nMethodology\nWhy English and Arabic subtitles? English is the language of\nmost audiovisual products, being the language of communication\nworldwide (lingua franca). It is the dominant language of com-\nmunication and is spoken by a huge number of people (Lyons,\n2021). According to Al-Zgoul and Al-Salman (2022), Holly-\nwood\u2019s \ufb01lmmaking companies and the movie industry in the US\nhave a wide reach due to the use of English.\nIn Arabic-speaking countries, subtitling, rather than dubbing,\nas an AVT mode is widespread. Movies are subtitled in Modern\nStandard Arabic (MSA), which is the high variety of Arabic.\nThe use of this variety may reduce the degree of offensiveness\nwhen translating culture-bound expressions, including swear\nwords, as MSA is used as a means of euphemism (Haider and\nHussein, 2022).\nCompared to other AVT modes, such as dubbing, audio\ndescription, and voiceover, corpus compilation in subtitling is the\neasiest, as the data is accessible and available in a written mode.\nAccordingly, there is no need for transcription, which is\ndemanding, daunting, and time-consuming.\nData selection and corpus compilation. This research is quali-\ntative and quantitative in nature. It uses an English-Arabic\nparallel corpus comprised of the original scripts of forty English\nmovies and their Arabic subtitles. The movies used in this study\nwere extracted from a larger parallel corpus of movie subtitles\ntitled \u201cEnglish-Arabic Movie Subtitles Corpus (EAMSC) (Abu\nRayyash and Haider, 2023). EAMSC is a 1,254,278-word corpus\nthat consists of 70 movie subtitles extracted from Net\ufb02ix and\nOSN with an IMDB rating of 8+. The researchers selected the\nmovies that met the following criteria: (a) falling into one of four\ngenres: drama, action, sci-\ufb01, or biography; (b) having a + 8\nrating on the IMDB website rating; (c) being translated by\nARTICLE\nHUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-01506-3\n4\nHUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS |  (2023) 10:39 | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-01506-3\nNet\ufb02ix; and d) containing a high frequency of swear words.\nForty movies were selected for the purpose of this study, as\nTable 1 shows.\nIn EAMSC, the English transcription and Arabic subtitles were\nextracted from Net\ufb02ix\u2019s of\ufb01cial website and opened using Aegisub\nto make the process of aligning the English dialog with its Arabic\ncounterpart easier since the in-time and out-time are shown, as\nillustrated in Figs. 1 and 2.\nThe English and Arabic data were copy-pasted to an excel\nsheet. Each movie is saved in a separate sheet with two columns;\nthe \ufb01rst column contains the English source text, while the second\ncolumn contains the Arabic subtitles. This step was followed by\nsegmenting and aligning the data. Data segmentation refers to\ndividing the subtitles into short segments: words, phrases, clauses,\nand sentences, while data alignment refers to putting the segment\nin the source text with its equivalent in the target text.\nThe total word count of the parallel corpus of the current\nstudy is 699,229 words comprising 372,071 words for the English\nsub-corpus and 327,158 words for the Arabic sub-corpus, as\nTable 2 shows.\nThe parallel corpus is analyzed using SketchEngine, which is a\nweb-based corpus\nprocessor\ndeveloped\nby\nAdam\nKilgariff\n(Kilgarriff et al., 2014). Sketch Engine includes some tools such\nas wordlist, n-gram, concordance, keywords, word sketch,\nthesaurus, and parallel concordance. In this study, the researchers\nuse the parallel concordance tool to generate concordance lines\nthat include the search term in the two investigated languages (see\nAl-Khalafat and Haider, 2022).\nThe researchers can select a query term or search word, which\nis referred to in the literature as a node word, and Sketch Engine\nwill \ufb01lter out the English/Arabic lines containing that word, i.e.,\nthe source script along with its translation will appear next to\neach other as Fig. 3 shows.\nAdopted translation model in the current study. In this study,\nwe adopt the model proposed by Khoshsaligheh and Ameri\n(2014), in which the taboo words can be subtitled using one of the\nfollowing ways:\nTable 1 Distribution of movies according to drama, action, sci-\ufb01, and biography genres.\nDrama\nAction\nSci-Fi\nBiography\nWhiplash\nThe Dark Knight\nInterstellar\nThe Pianist\nThe Martian\nThe Avengers\nMad Max Fury Road\nRush\nThe Father\nTYLER the Fellowship of the Ring\nV for Vendetta\nThe Imitation Game\nThe Shawshank Redemption\nMosul\nInception\nSpotlight\nGone Girl\nWarrior\nThe Matrix\nInto the Wild\nInto the Wild\nBatman Begins\nSpider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse\nThe Pursuit of Happiness\nThe King\u2019s Speech\nThe Bourne Ultimatum\nLogan\nLion\nThere will be Blood\nTLOFER the two Towers\nHer\nA Beautiful Mind\nShutter Island\nDjango Unchained\nBack to the Future\nGoodfellas\nThe Wolf of Wall Street\nGladiator\nThe Prestige\nLawrence of Arabia\nFig. 1 The Aegisub \ufb01le of the English source text extracted from Net\ufb02ix.\nFig. 2 The Aegisub \ufb01le of the Arabic subtitles extracted from Net\ufb02ix.\nTable 2 English-arabic movie subtitles parallel corpus size.\nEnglish\n372,071\nArabic\n327,158\nTotal\n699,229\nHUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-01506-3\nARTICLE\nHUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS |  (2023) 10:39 | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-01506-3\n5\n(1)\nTaboo-to-Taboo: the swear word in the source text is\nrendered using an equivalent in the target language (the\noffensiveness degree and load are maintained).\n(2)\nTaboo-to-non-taboo: the swear word in the source text is\nneutralized and substituted with a non-taboo expression\n(neutralization).\n(3)\nEuphemisation/softening: The swear word is translated using\na target language euphemistic expression (toning down).\n(4)\nOmission: Not translating the swear word and deleting it in\nthe target language (deletion)\nResearch procedures. This study follows the following proce-\ndures. First, selecting 40 English movies (drama, action, sci-\ufb01,\nand biography) that have a good number of swear words with\na + 8 rating on the IMDB website rating from the \u201cEnglish-\nArabic\nMovie\nSubtitles\nCorpus\n(EAMSC).\nSecond,\nusing\nSketchEngine to process the data and conduct frequency analysis\nto identify the ten most frequent words in the corpus. Jay (1992)\nargued that the most frequently used taboo words are fuck, shit,\nJesus/christ, hell, damn, ass, asshole, goddamn/god, bitch, piss, pig,\nbastard, bullshit, son of a bitch, whore, slut, cock, cocksucker,\nmotherfucker, queer, fag, dick, cunt, pussy, prick, screw, and crap.\nSimilarly, Beers F\u00e4gersten (2007) conducted a sociolinguistic\nanalysis of a set of swear words, namely ass, bastard, bitch, cunt,\ndamn, dick, fuck, hell, shit, and their derivatives, e.g., bullshit or\nGoddamn, which are be the most frequent and common (Jay,\n1977, 1980; Johnson and Fine, 1985). If any of these words were\namong the ten most frequent swear words in the corpus, they\nwould be further analyzed. Third, comparing the frequency of\nswear words in the four investigated genres. Fourth, using the\nparallel concordance tool to examine how swear words are ren-\ndered in Arabic, categorizing them into three groups, namely\nomission, softening, and swear-. Fifth, examining the usage of\ndifferent strategies grouped by swear words.\nAnalysis and results\nSwear words serve as\u201d translation crisis points\u201d since they fall\nwithin the category of culture-bound expressions, and render-\ning them could be very challenging for translators (Pedersen,\n2005, p. 1). Khalaf and Rashid (2019) stated that \ufb01lmmakers\npurposefully use swear words to re\ufb02ect the characters\u2019 socio-\ncultural and educational backgrounds and express their inner\nthoughts. The following sections explore the most frequent\nswear words in the investigated corpus and examine the stra-\ntegies used to render them.\nFrequency of swear words in the investigated genres. Using the\nwordlist tool in SketchEngine, the researchers created a frequency\nanalysis for the four sub-corpora to identify the most frequent\nswear words based on the classi\ufb01cation of some researchers (Jay,\n1977, 1980, 1992; Johnson and Fine, 1985). In the investigated\ncorpus, the most frequent ten swear words are: fuck, shit, damn,\nass, bitch, bastard, asshole, dick, cunt, and pussy, as Table 3 shows.\nThe researchers classi\ufb01ed the frequent words found in the\ncorpus based on the categorization of Jay (2009), which includes\nnine categories, namely, (1) sexual references, (2) profanity or\nblasphemy, (3) scatological and disgusting objects, (4) animal\nnames, (5) ethnic-racial-gender slurs, (6) psychological-physical-\nsocial deviations, (7) ancestral allusions, (8) substandard vulgar\nterms, and (9) offensive slang. Some words in the investigated\ncorpus contain sexual references, including sexual acts (fuck)\nand sexual anatomies (dick and cunt). The corpus also contained\nprofane and blasphemous words (e.g., damn), scatological and\ndisgusting objects, including excretion organs (ass and asshole),\nbody products (shit), animal names (bitch and pussy), and\nancestral allusions relating to family relationships and ancestors\n(e.g., bastard).\nFig. 3 SketchEngine parallel concordance for the word \u201casshole*\u201c with the Arabic equivalents.\nTable 3 Frequency of swear words along with their\nderivatives in each genre.\nSwear word\nDrama\nAction\nSci-Fi\nBiography\nTotal\nFuck*\n701\n50\n89\n37\n877\nShit*\n140\n40\n60\n51\n291\nDamn\n23\n30\n31\n15\n99\nAss\n24\n35\n14\n20\n93\nBitch*\n21\n33\n9\n12\n75\nBastard*\n5\n11\n6\n12\n34\nAsshole*\n17\n19\n10\n11\n57\nDick*\n12\n2\n3\n3\n20\nCunt*\n8\n3\n1\n1\n13\nPussy*\n2\n1\n2\n0\n5\nTotal\n953\n224\n225\n162\n1564\nWildcards (*) are used to include the term along with its variants.

According to Andersson and Trudgill\n(1992, p. 60), the word fuck is \u201cone of the most interesting and\ncolorful words in the English language today.\u201d It can be used to\ndescribe different emotions, including love, pleasure, hatred, and\npain (McEnery and Xiao, 2004).In addition, the f-words have\ncultural and social interpretations and are part of the dramatic\nplot in various movie genres. According to Pujol (2006), the\nword \u201cfuck\u201d is employed in movies to communicate severe\nwrath, emphasis, disgust, disdain, surprise, and delight, pointing\nout that these categories are not exhaustive and sometimes\noverlap. The word \u201cshit\u201d was the second most frequently used\nswear word in the data, with 291 hits. Kristiano and Ardi (2018)\nconducted a semantic analysis of the swear words in Bad Boys II\nand found that the word shit was the most frequent swear word\nin the movie, followed by fuck. The frequency of each of the\nremaining swear words did not exceed 100 hits.\nIt is worth noting that the intensity of offensiveness varies\nbased on the word used. Beers F\u00e4gersten (2007, p. 5) argued that\n\u201ccertain swear words are consistently rated more offensive than\nothers, with sexual terms receiving higher offensiveness scores\nthan excretory/body and sacred terms.\u201d For example, swear\nwords like fuck and motherfucker are rated higher than ass,\nasshole, and shit. These are rated higher than hell, and damn. It\nis worth noting that dick and cunt received a high offensive\nrating. According to (Ljung, 2011, p. 9), \u201cthe BBC guidelines do\nmention the three words considered most offensive, viz. cunt,\nfuck, and motherfucker\u201d. The investigated words in this study\ncan be rated from the most offensive to the least as cunt, fuck\n(including motherfucker), bitch, asshole, bastard, pussy, dick, ass,\nshit, and damn.\nSwear words were used the most in drama movies, with a\npercentage of 61%, followed by action and sci-\ufb01with 14% for\neach, and biography (11%), as Fig. 4 shows.\nClearly, the drama genre has the lion\u2019s share in the use of swear\nwords by more than half of the total hits of the other movies\ncollectively. Adriani and Hamzah (2013, p. 72) stated that\n\u201cDrama Movie is a genre of movies with serious presentations or\nstories with settings or life situations that portray realistic\ncharacters in con\ufb02ict with either themselves, others, or forces of\nnature.\u201d Therefore, the dramatic elements in the plot can be\nre\ufb02ected in the frequent inclusion of swear words that serve as a\npopulist reservoir of language. This can help convey ideas and\nemotions more effectively.\nTranslation strategies used in rendering swear words\nOmission. Omission is a strategy where the translator deletes part\nof the expression or leaves it out fully. It is one of the most\ncommon practices in translation, especially when the translator\nfails to render the source language expression due to temporal,\nspatial, or cultural constraints. In this study, subtitlers resorted to\nthis strategy the most. This could be due to the strict censorship\npolicies and cultural constraints that subtitlers should abide by.\nTable 4 shows the number of instances in which the subtitler\nomitted the swear word.\nTable 4 shows that omission was the most used strategy in\nrendering swear words in drama movies, with 633 hits (66%),\nfollowed by action movies (61%), sci-Fi (40%), and biography\n(52%). Additionally, Table 4 shows that the deletion of words\nvaries from one swear word to another. For example, in drama\nmovies, the swear words \u201cass,\u201d \u201cfuck,\u201d and \u201cshit\u201d were the most\nomitted words, with (75), (73), and (73%) respectively. In drama\nmovies, the subtitlers did not resort to the translation strategy of\nomission in rendering the swear words cunt, bitch, asshole,\nbastard, and \u201cpussy\u201d. These words, especially \u201ccunt\u201d have high\noffensiveness scores and can be omitted rather than softened or\nsubstituted. The frequency of these words in Drama movies is 69,\nwhich is relatively low when compared to the other \ufb01ve\ninvestigated words. It can also be observed that in the four\nFig. 4 Swear words in the four investigated movie genres.\nTable 4 Number and percentage of using omission in the four investigated genres.\nSwear word\nDrama\nAction\nSci-Fi\nBiography\nTotal\nOmi.\n%\nTotal\nOmi.\n%\nTotal\nOmi.\n%\nTotal\nOmi.\n%\nFuck\n692\n506\n73%\n59\n23\n39%\n89\n38\n43%\n37\n22\n59%\nShit\n134\n94\n70%\n45\n29\n64%\n60\n20\n33%\n51\n30\n59%\nDamn\n22\n10\n45%\n30\n24\n80%\n31\n17\n55%\n15\n10\n67%\nAss\n24\n18\n75%\n35\n31\n89%\n14\n12\n86%\n20\n11\n55%\nBitch\n31\n0\n0%\n25\n22\n88%\n9\n1\n11%\n6\n6\n100%\nBastard\n7\n0\n0%\n12\n0\n0%\n6\n1\n17%\n12\n3\n25%\nAsshole\n17\n0\n0%\n12\n7\n58%\n10\n0\n0%\n17\n2\n12%\nDick\n12\n5\n42%\n2\n0\n0%\n3\n1\n33%\n3\n0\n0%\nCunt\n9\n0\n0%\n3\n0\n0%\n1\n0\n0%\n1\n0\n0%\nPussy\n5\n0\n0%\n1\n0\n0%\n2\n0\n0%\n0\n0\n0%\nTotal\n953\n633\n66%\n224\n136\n61%\n225\n90\n40%\n162\n84\n52%\nHUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-01506-3\nARTICLE\nHUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS |  (2023) 10:39 | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-01506-3\n7\ninvestigated genres, the subtitlers did not use the strategy of\n\u201comission\u201d in translating the swear words \u201ccunt\u201d and \u201cpussy\u201d.\nThe choice of omission may depend on the function of the\nswear words in the utterance, i.e., whether they are interjections\n(e.g., Shit! Fuck!) and mainly used to express the speakers\u2019\nreactions including anger, surprise, pain, and other feelings,\nemphasizers (e.g., what the hell is the matter?\u201d, or slot \ufb01llers (e.g.,\nbloody fool), or replacive (Ljung, 2011).\nAs stated before, omission is the act of dropping a word from the\ntarget language while translating. The cultural variations between the\nSL and TL may necessitate applying omission in order to escape a\npotential cultural predicament. Resorting to omission is commonly\nused in subtitling when compared to other translation modes. This\nstudy revealed that subtitlers\u2019 omission is the most frequently\nemployed strategy when rendering swear words from English into\nArabic. The subtitlers may omit swear words that have no equivalents\nin the target language or elicit negative reactions from the audience.\nAccording to Abdelaal and Al Sarhani (2021), omission can be used\ndue to constraints in the target culture, making it tough to render\nsome swear words into Arabic, particularly those that are considered\nhighly derogatory and abhorrent. Another reason for adopting this\nstrategy in subtitling is spatial constraints, which allow for a limited\nnumber of characters. Table 5 shows some examples of how this\nstrategy was used in the data.\nAs Table 5 shows, the ST swear words \u201cdick,\u201d \u201cfucking\u201d, \u201cdamn,\u201d\nand \u201cass\u201d were omitted from the subtitles. When resorting to this\nstrategy, the \u201cconnotative\u201d function of swear words is not\nmaintained, and the sentence\u2019s overall meaning is affected.\nAccording to Al-Yasin and Rabab\u2019ah (2019, p. 22), this may result\n\u201cinto missing the pragmatic function of the utterance since the\noccurrence of the taboo word may indicate a certain feeling like\nanger or surprise.\u201d Hendal (2021) stated that the omission strategy\nmight not alter the original meaning but instead remove the\nauthor\u2019s sentiments. Hence, rendering swear words using the\nomission strategy leads to the neglect of the feelings involved in\nthe screenplay, as illustrated in the above examples. This is\nsupported by Al-Adwan and Yahiaoui (2018, p. 88) who argue that\n\u201cmodifying or cutting parts of the original contents of foreign \ufb01lms\nwould affect the experience of the Arab audience and present to\nthem an altered representation of the original plot and characters\u201d.\nSoftening. The subtitlers use the softening strategy as it relatively\nsatis\ufb01es the viewers of the conservative target culture without\nmuch neglect of the linguistic function of the swear words.\nSoftening refers to the translation of the ST swear word by using a\nTL swear word that is gentler or milder in tone (D\u00edaz-P\u00e9rez,\n2020). Professional subtitlers had little choice but to hold the stick\nin mid-air to avoid falling prey to the critic\u2019s hammer when\nrendering the swear words. Table 6 summarizes the distribution\nof the softening strategy in the investigated genres.\nTable 6 shows that the softening strategy was most observed in\nsci-\ufb01movies (39%) and least used in drama movies (20%). Some\nexamples of this strategy are shown in Table 7.\nTable 7 shows that the Arabic word \u201c\ufeed\ufecf\ufeaarogue\u201d was the most\nused by the subtitlers in rendering various swear words such as\n\u201casshole\u201d (example 9) and \u201cdick\u201d (examples 12 and 15).

As discussed before, the subtitles are written in Modern\nStandard Arabic (MSA) rather than vernaculars, with the former\nbeing a vehicle of polite language and does not use impolite\nterms, while the latter associating with lowly and nonprestigious\nfunctions, vulgarisms, and obscene words. According to Haider\nand Hussein (2022, p. 3), \u201cwords tend to be formal and polite in\nMSA, while their equivalents in colloquial lack this attribute.\u201d\nWords like\ufeed\ufecf\ufeaarogue and\ufeb3\ufe8e\ufed3\ufedeimmoral/scummy are offensive\nwords in Arabic. However, they are not as offensive as the English\nwords, most likely because of the used variety of Arabic in the\nsubtitles. Based on this, it can be argued that the use of some\nequivalent terms in Arabic, like\ufecb\ufe8e\ufeeb\ufeae\ufe93bitch would more directly\ntranslate the original English terms when compared to other\nequivalents, such as\ufeb3\ufe8e\ufed3\ufee0\ufe94immoral.\nSince subtitlers are aware that SL swear words are undesirable\nto TL individuals and society, they choose to tone them down.\nResorting to this strategy gives the subtitlers more freedom to\ninterpret the meaning in the cinematic dialog. Thus, the subtitlers\nsucceeded to some extent in softening the swear words and\nmitigating their impact on the viewer in a way that preserved the\ngeneral meaning of these words.\nSwear to non-Swear. This strategy indicates turning the SL swear\nword into a TL non-swear word that has a neutral emotive\nmeaning (D\u00edaz-P\u00e9rez, 2020). Swear-to-non-swear, or taboo-for-\nnon-taboo translation, occurs when the translated text is neu-\ntralized. Table 8 summarizes the distribution of the swear-to-non-\nswear strategy in the investigated genres.\nTable 8 shows that the softening strategy was most observed in\nsci-\ufb01movies (21%) and least used in action movies (11%). Table 8\nindicates the number and percentage of using the swear-to-non-\nswear strategy in the investigated four movie genres.

In example 23, which reads \u201cstart the bastard,\u201d the\nsubtitler replaced bastard with\ufeb3\ufef4\ufe8e\ufead\ufe93car. According to Al-Zgoul\nand Al-Salman (2022) replacive swearing plays a role in building\nthe context. In example 21, the swear word \u201cass\u201d was substituted\nwith a more general word, \u201cbody,\u201d while in example 26, the same\nword was replaced with \u201ca girl.\u201d\nTable 10 shows the number of occurrences and the percentage\nof each subtitling strategy used to render swear words from\nEnglish into Arabic in the four investigated movie genres, namely,\ndrama, action, sci-\ufb01, and biography.\nAs can be observed from the data, the omission strategy\naccounted for the lion\u2019s share in the number of swear words in all\nthe different genres mentioned, with 66% for drama, 61% for\naction, 40% for sci-\ufb01, and 52% for biography. On the other hand,\nthe softening strategy got the second-highest frequencies across\nthe different movie genres, with 39% for sci-\ufb01, 32% for biography,\n28% for action, and 20 for drama. In addition, the swear-to-non-\nswear strategy was the least often adopted by subtitlers in\nrendering swear words from English into Arabic, accounting for\n21% for sci-\ufb01, 16% for biography, 14% for drama, and 11% for\naction (see Fig. 5).\nThe strategy of omission was used in about two-third of the\nswear words as Fig. 5 shows. This strategy could be the easiest for\nthe subtitlers, as it does not require any effort from the subtitlers.\nHowever, using it densely may affect the meaning and sometimes\nlead to poor translation (Al-Zgoul and Al-Salman, 2022). It can\nbe argued that omission occurred due to technical or cultural\nconstraints, with the former relating to the spatial and temporal\naspects of the subtitles and the latter to the differences between\nliberal and conservative cultures. Antonini (2005) argued that\nomission is a reduction strategy resulting from the technical\nconstraints of time and space.

Resorting to the strategy of\nomission seems to be relatively common, as it was discussed by\ndifferent scholars (ElShiekh, 2016; Hosseinnia, 2014; Simanjuntak\nand Basari, 2016). Using this strategy is not haphazard and\nrequires a profound knowledge of the connotative functions of\nthe linguistic elements so that susbtitlers compensate for the loss\nthat occurred due to the act of deletion. To re\ufb02ect and recap,\nomission affects utterances due to what Matkivska (2014)\nexplained as the synchronism of the characteristic, which entails\ndelivering the meaning of the whole audiovisual product within\nthe technical constraints. The other two strategies that were used\nby the subtitlers are softening (euphemism) and swear-to-non-\nswear (neutralization). These two strategies could be better\nchoices when compared to omission, as the loss of the meaning\nresulting from the deletion of the swear words may affect the\ncomprehension of the target audience. The \ufb01ndings of this study\nare in harmony with those of Cuenca (2016) who examined the\nstrategies used in subtitling taboo words from English into\nSpanish and found that omission, euphemism, and neutralization\nwere employed by the subtitlers.\nAs mentioned before, ten swear words were spotted to be\nfurther investigated. These included fuck, shit, damn, ass, bitch,\nbastard, asshole, dick, cunt, and pussy. Table 11 shows the usage\nof different strategies, grouped by swear words.\nOmission was the most used translation strategy in rendering\nthe words fuck, shit, damn, and ass; softening was used primarily\nin translating the words pussy, cunt, bastard, asshole, dick, and\nbitch. Swear-to-non-swear was mainly used with the swear words\nasshole, bastard, and cunt. The strength and offensiveness of the\ninvestigated swear words are discussed. On this basis, \u2018stronger\u2019\nswear words would invite different strategies, i.e., strong swear\nwords would be omitted, while less offensive words would be\nsoftened or substituted. The investigated words in this study can\nbe rated from the most offensive to the least as cunt, fuck\n(including motherfucker), bitch, asshole, bastard, pussy, dick, ass,\nshit, and damn. However, as argued above, with the use of the\nMSA variety of Arabic, these words would lose their strength or\noffensiveness. Accordingly, the level of offensiveness in the source\ntext is not maintained in the target text.\nTo help subtitlers, translation students and translation training\nprograms render the ten swear words investigated in this study\ninto Arabic, the researchers summarized the most frequent\nArabic translations of these words. The swear words are\nsometimes rendered literally in a euphemistic way; for example,\nthe word fuck was rendered as\ufef3\ufec0\ufe8e\ufe9f\ufecaget laid/make love 24 times.\nHowever, other times, they are used connotatively. For example,\nthe Arabic word\ufe97\ufe92\ufe8e\n(Lit. doom and lose) was used 163 times to\nrender the words fuck (92 times), shit (60), and damn (11). Give a\ndamn/fuck\nwas\nmainly\nrendered\nusing\nthe\neuphemistic\nexpressions\ufef3\ufe84\ufe91\ufeea\u060c \ufef3\ufecc\ufe92\ufe84\u060c \ufcde\ufc72\u060c \ufef3\ufe92\ufe8e\ufc44\n,meaning care. Similarly, the\nword\ufe8d\ufedf\ufee0\ufecc\ufee8\ufe94\n(Lit. curse) was the most frequently used in translating\nEnglish swear words, where it is used 118 times to render the\nwords fuck, shit, and damn. Arabic epithets like\ufe8d\ufcaa\ufed6fool (5\ntimes),\ufe83\ufea7\ufeae\ufed5clumsy (5 times),\ufea3\ufe9c\ufe8e\ufedf\ufe94scum (22),\ufea3\ufed8\ufef4\ufeaedespicable\n(19 times),\ufed7\ufeac\ufeadnasty (19 times),\ufeed\ufebf\ufef4\ufecalowly (3 times),\ufecf\ufc6fstupid\n(3 times),\ufee7\ufeac\ufeddvillain (4 times) and\ufeed\ufecf\ufeaanasty (16 times). Some\ntense Arabic attributes were also observed in the data, such as\n\ufea9\ufe8d\ufecb\ufeaesluttish,\ufea9\ufe8d\ufecb\ufeae\ufe93whore,\ufeb3\ufe8e\ufed3\ufedebastard,\ufeb3\ufe8e\ufed3\ufee0\ufe94Bitch,\ufeb3\ufe8e\ufed7\ufec4\ufe94\nBitch,\ufecb\ufe8e\ufeeb\ufeae\ufe93whore,\ufed3\ufe8e\ufe9f\ufeae\ufe93whore, and\ufedf\ufed8\ufef4\ufec2bastard. Some\neuphemistic expressions to refer to body organs were frequently\nused, such as\ufe8d\ufedf\ufecc\ufec0\ufeee\ufe8d\ufef7\ufee7\ufe9c\ufeee\ufef1\ufe8d\ufedf\ufe98\ufee8\ufe8e\ufeb3\ufc87female genital organ,\ufe8d\ufccc\ufee8\ufec4\ufed8\ufe94\n\ufe8d\ufccb\ufe8e\ufebb\ufe94private area,\ufe83\ufecb\ufec0\ufe8e\ufe80\ufe97\ufee8\ufe8e\ufeb3\ufee0\ufef4\ufe94genitals,\ufe9f\ufeb4\ufeaabody,\ufecb\ufec0\ufeeeorgan,\n\ufead\ufe9f\ufeee\ufedf\ufe94manhood, and\ufee3\ufe86\ufea7\ufeae\ufe93butt. Other times, literal translation\nwas used to render some words like\ufed7\ufec0\ufef4\ufe90dick.\nConclusion\nThis study combines corpus linguistics and audiovisual transla-\ntion to examine the translation strategies adopted by Net\ufb02ix\nsubtitlers in rendering swear words in 40 English movies into\nArabic. Swear words express the speaker\u2019s sentiments and reac-\ntions in an impolite manner (Moore, 2012). Swear words can be\nobserved frequently in some movies. Various genres, such as\ndrama, action, and comedy, to mention a few, include different\nswear words to convey some messages in a particular way. The\ntranslation of swear words is a subject of contention among\ntranslators and researchers, especially if the target culture is\nconservative. Ten swear words, namely fuck, shit, damn, ass,\nbitch, bastard, asshole, dick, cunt, and pussy were frequently\nobserved in the data. Going through the data and comparing the\nEnglish\nswear\nwords\nwith\ntheir\nArabic\nequivalents,\nthe\nresearchers classi\ufb01ed the strategies of rendering swear words into\nthree categories: omitting the ST swear words from the target text,\nrendering ST swear words into TT non-swear words, and soft-\nening the ST swear words. The analysis showed that omission is\nthe most frequently used strategy by professional subtitlers in\nrendering English swear words into Arabic.\nWhile the results obtained in the current study are aligned with\nthe research questions, there have been some limitations and\nrecommendations. The current study\u2019s data were retrieved from\nNet\ufb02ix; future studies may investigate fansubbing as they are\nabundantly available via different websites1. Future research can\nalso bulid on the few studies that investigated subtitles of pro-\nminnat satellite channels in the Arab World (see Al-Adwan, 2019;\nAl-Jaberi et al., 2021). This study was conducted on four movie\ngenres, as the other genres are not available in abundance com-\npared to drama, action, sci-\ufb01, and biography on the one hand,\nand their inclusion of plenty of swear words on the other hand.\nOther genres can be the data source for future studies.\nTable 11 Total hits of each swear word using the three strategies.\nSwear word\nOmission\n%\nSoftening\n%\nSwear-to-non-Swear\n%\nTotal hits\nFuck\n589\n67%\n170\n19%\n118\n14%\n877\nShit\n173\n60%\n80\n27%\n38\n13%\n291\nDamn\n61\n62%\n25\n25%\n13\n13%\n99\nAss\n72\n77%\n14\n15%\n7\n8%\n93\nBitch\n29\n38%\n32\n43%\n14\n19%\n75\nBastard\n4\n12%\n19\n56%\n11\n32%\n34\nAsshole\n9\n16%\n29\n51%\n19\n33%\n57\nDick\n6\n30%\n9\n45%\n5\n25%\n20\nCunt\n0\n0%\n9\n69%\n4\n31%\n13\nPussy\n0\n0%\n4\n80%\n1\n20%\n5\nTotal\n943\n60%\n391\n25%\n230\n15%\n1564\nHUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-01506-3\nARTICLE\nHUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS |  (2023) 10:39 | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-01506-3\n11\nThis study uses a parallel corpus of English-Arabic movie sub-\ntitles and recommends more corpus-assisted studies on different\nAVT modes, including dubbing, voiceover, and free commentaries.\nFurthermore, the researchers recommend more AVT research on\nswear words in different languages, as they represent a con-\ntroversial issue, especially when translating for conservative cul-\ntures. This study investigated a large chunk of data quantitatively;\nother studies may attempt to identify fansubbing norms in a\nlimited number of movies as this may allow them to examine them\nin detail. This study was limited to translation strategies; other\nstudies may examine the denotative and connotative functions of\nswear words and the typology of swearing.\nTo conclude, further research on the different AVT modes is\nneeded to help translators identify the best and most appropriate\nstrategies to opt for when rendering culture-bound expressions,\nincluding swearing. Such research will signi\ufb01cantly help sub-\ntitlers, translation students, and translation training programs.\nData availability\nThe data are available on request from the authors.\nReceived: 21 June 2022; Accepted: 4 January 2023;\nNote\n1 Such as www.subscene.com.\nReferences\nAbdelaal NM, Al Sarhani A (2021) Subtitling strategies of swear words and taboo\nexpressions in the movie \u201cTraining Day\u201d.

DOI: https://dx.doi.org/10.33394/jollt.v12i1.8377 \nINTRODUCTION  \nEnglish has been used worldwide as predominant language to reduce differenced in \neconomic, political, and social aspects. The ability to speak English fluently has become the \nmain concern in education. In Indonesia, English is taught since primary school. However, \nmost of Indonesians have poor levels of linguistic proficiency and cannot speak English \nfluently. It refers to EF EPI data in 2021, Indonesia is ranked 80 out of 112 countries and is in \n14th position out of 24 Asian countries (Winnie et al., 2023). In fact, Indonesia lost to \nASEAN countries such as Vietnam and the Philippines, which were in 66th and 18th \npositions respectively. Thus, solution from this lack of Indonesian English competency not \nonly comes from EFL teachers and educators but it has to be equally discussed by EFL \nlearners themselves.   \nOne way to solve this issue, the EFL learners have to grow enthusiasm for self-\ndirected learning. Learners with initiated approach to learn English beyond the classroom not \nonly indicate that those learners see English as integral to ensuring their personal well-being \nin their own futures, but as also vital for an in-depth understanding of western social values, \nwhich will empower them to become world citizens. Nowadays, with adequate access to the \ninternet and enormous video resources. Many EFL learners attempt to utilize potentially \nuseful technology to promote students\u2019 self-directed learning. It is a well-known fact that the \nuse of audio-visual materials such as videos makes the process of language learning \nMaharani, Jayanti, & Afifi \nPromoting Self-Directed Learning \u2026\u2026\u2026.. \n \nJOLLT Journal of Languages and Language Teaching, January 2024. Vol.12, No.1   | 213  \n \nstimulating and facilitating. In addition, these materials can bring flexibility to language \nlearning procedure, and help students develop communicative skills, listening comprehension \nand expand vocabulary (Toleuzhan et al., 2023). This study is informed by the theory of \nmultimedia learning by (Mayer & Johnson, 2008).  \nAccording to this theory, learners comprehend information most effectively through \ndual channels\u2014a verbal channel that processes written text and a visual channel that \nprocesses images and video. When one of these channels is absent, such as in the case of L2 \nvideo without captions or subtitles, then learning is suboptimal. Instead, learning is facilitated \nthrough the simultaneous use of these two channels as an audiovisual presentation allows \ninput to be processed by both the verbal and visual systems, which in turn, allows for more \ncognitive resources to be devoted to the processing of information compared to verbal or \nwritten information only (Br\u00fcnken et al., 2004). \nVideo designs that comply to the Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning are \ngenerally more engaging, more memorable, and are more effective in presenting complex \ninformation and processes compared to text-based or visual-based medium. The Cognitive \nTheory of Multimedia Learning proposes multimedia such as audio and visual elements \n(words and graphics) facilitate active learning. This theory is strongly related to information \nprocessing model, which emphasizes how multimedia representation, sensory memory, \nworking memory and long-term memory are interrelated (Mayer & Johnson, 2008). This \ntheory explains the cognitive activities such as selecting words, selecting images, organizing \nwords and organizing images, and more importantly how these activities (or information) are \nintegrated coherently with the learner\u2019s prior knowledge in working memory. This will then \nlead to the meaning-making process, which is called as learning. The cognitive activities \ndemand a high level of attention and reflection from the learner\u2019s.  \nThus, one easiest way to increase the enthusiasm of self-directed learning is by \nconsuming popular English language movies and dramas (Wang, 2012). Various types of \nvideo images such as English language movies and dramas become one of concern of \neducators and researchers since it can enhances students\u2019 learning experience (Syrymbetova et \nal., 2021). In line with the previous statement, (Suleiman et al., 2019). stated that video \nmovies can be an effective way in learning target language. It can promote self-directed \nlearning where students could study the video in their own time. Several studies also revealed \nthat movies can become an integral part of language study due to their significant effect on \nthe development of basic language skills: reading, listening, speaking, and writing (Yaseen & \nShakir, 2015). \nThere are lot of subscription video provider that supply demand on English-based \nmovies and videos. However, from those kind of subcription video providers such as, \nDisney+ Hostar, Viu, iFlix, weTV, HBO Go, Mola, Amazon PrimeVideo and Netflix. \nHowever, cited from demandsage.com, Netflix has 230.7 million subscribers worldwide and \nhas averaged 3.2 hours each day of streaming content with thousands titles of series, movies, \ndocumentaries, and TV shows in different languages and subtitling choices. Therefore, as \nleading provider of subscription video on demand which over wide variety of award-winning \nseries, movies, documentaries and TV shows with multi-language subtitles, speech transcript, \nand dubbing as well as its convenience and mobility to watch anywhere on any devices, \nNetflix can be a good learning media for EFL students of all levels (Alm, 2021). In Indonesia \nitself, a survey conducted by Rakuten Insight in May 2021 showed that Netflix is also the \nmost favorite SVod service with 72.29% of respondents choosing it. Moreover, Netflix also \nhas the highest number of original content in various languages consisting of films, TV series, \ndocumentaries and much more (Nurhayati-Wolff, 2021). \nFrom the large number of Netflix users in Indonesia ranging from children to adults, \nthis video on demand streaming platform has great potential as a medium for learning \nMaharani, Jayanti, & Afifi \nPromoting Self-Directed Learning \u2026\u2026\u2026.. \n \nJOLLT Journal of Languages and Language Teaching, January 2024. Vol.12, No.1   | 214  \n \nEnglish. In this case, if EFL learners find it difficult to meet native speakers in their \nenvironment, films and TV shows become the greatest source for learning English language. \nFurthermore, if students are willing to learn overseas in order finding authentic resources, it\u2019s \nnot cost-free. In spite of that, some Indonesian students who are studying in English Speaking \nCountries showed positive results in their English abilities by also learning through Netflix \n(Jackson, 2020). In addition, formal study abroad programs usually require candidates to pass \ninternational standard English proficiency tests before they set foot outside Indonesia, which \nto some extent has prevented many Indonesian learners from going abroad to study English. \nFor this reason, EFL learners have sought alternatives, including watching Netflix at home, as \na remedy for their insufficient exposure to English-speaking societies and English authentic \nresources. \n Nowadays, the exploration of the Netflix potential as a learning medium in the context \nof self-directed learning, especially its influence on EFL learners' listening and speaking \nskills, still needs to be done. By taking more understanding about Netflix's potential as a \nlearning medium, it will have implications for several aspects of English teaching and \nlearning, especially for EFL learners. First, a better understanding will be obtained regarding \nEFL learners' perceptions of Netflix, which is not only as an entertainment medium but also \nas an English language learning medium. In this context, research conducted by researchers \ncan provide a clearer picture of how students' perceptions of English language skills at UIN \nMalang use Netflix to support them in learning English, especially in listening and speaking \nskills. \nSecond, Netflix is predicted to be able to encourage the achievement of learning \noutcomes for EFL learners with many alternative learning media. As part of learning \ntechnology, Netflix can realize a concept of teaching less learning more. This means that \nphysically the teacher's activities in class are reduced because some of the teacher's tasks are \ndelegated to the media, but still encourage the achievement of maximum student learning \noutcomes. Furthermore, exploring Netflix as a learning medium will help overcome the \nlimitations of teaching materials because Netflix is relatively cheap, easy to access and \noperate. Thus, Netflix can become a more meaningful language learning medium, not boring \nand motivate EFL students to learn English. \nBased on those three main benefits of the use of Netflix, thus, the purpose of this study \nis to understand more deeply how English Education Department students\u2019 perceptions \nperceive the use of Netflix as a medium for learning English outside the classroom which \nencourages self-directed learning and its impact on their listening and speaking skills. More \nspecifically, this study aims to answer three questions. First, how do English Education \nDepartment students perceive Netflix as a language learning medium? Second, how does \nNetflix promote their self-directed learning? Third, does Netflix affect their listening and \nspeaking skills? \n \nRESEARCH METHOD  \nResearch Design  \nIn conducting this research, the researcher uses mixed-method approach focusing on \nsequential explanatory research design. The sequential approach undertakes where the \nquantitative phase is followed by the qualitative phase (Creswell & Creswell, 2018). The \nqualitative findings are used to contextualize, enhance and enrich the quantitative data \nfindings (Creswell et al., 2011). In this study, the data collection technique is using \nquestionnaire and interviews. This is in line with Bowen et al. (2017), in his study, who \nexplained that the data collection method for explanatory sequential approach is based on \nquestionnaire/survey and interview/one to one telephone.  \nMaharani, Jayanti, & Afifi \nPromoting Self-Directed Learning \u2026\u2026\u2026.. \n \nJOLLT Journal of Languages and Language Teaching, January 2024. Vol.12, No.1   | 215  \n \nThe questionnaire result is aimed to reveal the percentage of students\u2019 perceptions \ntoward the utilization of Netflix as an aid to enhance listening and speaking comprehension \nskills. Then, for the qualitative data findings, namely from the interview transcripts, it is used \nto strengthen the quantitative findings and used to find any other stuff or materials that \nsupport the research findings beyond the item of the questionnaires. The following figure will \nexpose the overview of the research, adopted from Bowen et al. (2017), but had been \nreformulated by the researcher based on the research needs: \n \nFigure 1. Overview of Sequential Explanatory Research Design \n(Source: Adopted from Bowen et al. (2017) \nPopulation and Sample  \nThe population of the study is students at English Education Department who follow \nspeaking and listening courses which were using Audio and Visual strategies. There are two \nclasses for the population within 60 students. From the population, researcher doing a \npurposive sampling which each sample was chosen to be sample representative who had \nfulfilled the respondents\u2019 requirements (Barreiro & Albandoz, 2001). The requirements are: \n(1) Students from English Education Department UIN Maulana Malik Ibrahim Malang; (2) \nUse Netflix as digital aid to watch English movies; and (3) Follow speaking and listening \ncourses. In this case, the sample who becomes respondents are 15 students. Then, there are \nfive informants of the interviews who support the data from the questionnaires.  \nInstruments  \n \nThe instruments used in this study were questionnaires and interview. The \nquestionnaire is adapted from Dizon (2018) aimed to examine students\u2019 perception toward \nNetflix. While, the researcher develop and used the interview to get deeper understanding on \nhow Netflix affect learners\u2019 listening and speaking skills. The questionnaires itself consist of \nthree main parts covers the background of the participants to gather the personal information \nof the participants consist of participants\u2019 gender, year of enrollment in English education \ndepartment, how long they have subscribed to Netflix, how they access Netflix, and their \nfrequency in accessing Netflix. The second part is about learners\u2019 perception toward watching \nEnglish movies in Netflix.

The researcher distributed the \nquestionnaires online using Google Form then directly share the link via WhatsApp. After \ngaining the data from questionnaires, the researcher conducted an online interview also using \nWhatsApp to get deeper meaning from learners\u2019 questionnaires result and explore more on \nhow Netflix affect their speaking and listening skills. \n \nData Analysis  \nIn the realm of data analysis methodologies, the examination of questionnaire results \ninvolves a meticulous computation of percentages corresponding to each individual item. This \napproach serves as a quantitative means to distill and quantify the information gleaned from \nthe responses. Concurrently, the qualitative analysis of data adopts a structured framework \ninformed by the methodological stages delineated by Huberman and Miles (1984), as \nexpounded upon by Fadli (2021). The analytical framework employed in this study involves a \nsequential progression through distinct stages of data analysis, each contributing to the overall \nrobustness of the research inquiry. The initial phase, data reduction, operates systematically to \nstreamline and condense the dataset, facilitating focused and concentrated scrutiny of \npertinent information. Following this, the data presentation stage unfolds, characterized by a \nmethodical organization of refined data to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the \nnuanced intricacies within the dataset. The conclusive phase, data conclusion, represents the \nculmination of the analytical process, where findings are synthesized to derive meaningful \ninsights and implications. Notably, this study adopts a dual-method approach, seamlessly \nintegrating both quantitative and qualitative techniques. This intentional amalgamation serves \nto fortify the analytical rigor of the research endeavor, thereby enhancing the credibility and \ndepth of the study's findings. Consequently, this multifaceted analytical strategy contributes to \na nuanced comprehension of the phenomena under investigation within the designated \nresearch domain. \n \nRESEARCH FINDINGS AND DISCUSSION  \nQuestionnaire Results \nThe data that was obtained by the researcher from the result of a questionnaire \nfocusing on the English education department students\u2019 perception toward Netflix as digital \nL2 learning aid on their listening and speaking skills. First of all, before going to the deeper \ninformation about the participants\u2019 perception, the researcher made sure that all of them have \nbeen in line with the participant requirements. There are two requirements for the participants \nnamely, first, they are English education department students\u2019 at UIN Maulana Malik Ibrahim \nMalang. Second, they used Netflix as their audio-visual aid to watch English movies or \nvideos. This is as suggested by (Johnson et al., 2016), a questionnaire was self report \nthat each participant fills out as data-collection instrument.  \nThe first category was about participants\u2019 gender information and their year of \nenrolment to English Education Department at UIN Malang. It was found 3 male and 12 \nfemales which all of them are English Education Students. The second category was about \nstudents\u2019 Netflix access which was asking about the time of students began to subscrib Netflix \naid. The results showed from the 15 participants, 13 of them subscribed to Netflix since the \nfirst Corona Virus outbreak and the rest of them subscribed to Netflix before pandemic. This \nindicated that all of the participant had been in line with the participants\u2019 requirements. \nBefore going to the main issues namely the participants\u2019 perception toward the use of Netflix \nas an aid to help their listening and speaking learning processes. These are the results of the \nstudents\u2019 perceptions toward the use of Netflix to improve their English in general, the \nquestionnaires are as follows. \n \nMaharani, Jayanti, & Afifi \nPromoting Self-Directed Learning \u2026\u2026\u2026.. \n \nJOLLT Journal of Languages and Language Teaching, January 2024.

I only listen and watch the \nvideo, not practice my speaking skill, even my writing skill.\u201d  \nFrom the interview transcripts, the first and the second questions explored about the \nadvantages of Netflix as digital L2 learning aid in general and as digital learning aid in L2 \nlanguage learning context. The third is about the disadvantages of Netflix as digital learning \naid. Then, for the rest two questions, researcher focused on asking the advantages of the \nEnglish movies and series in Netflix toward the two main issues, namely listening and \nspeaking comprehension skills.  \nMaharani, Jayanti, & Afifi \nPromoting Self-Directed Learning \u2026\u2026\u2026.. \n \nJOLLT Journal of Languages and Language Teaching, January 2024. Vol.12, No.1   | 222  \n \nBased on the informants\u2019 answers, from the first question, it was found that Netflix is \nsuch a fresh, fun, interesting L2 learning media and it is also easy to use. Netflix provided its \nuser with subtitle too. So, they can listen while checking the pronunciation by native speakers \nin Netflix movies and series conversations. Then, for the second answers, it was found that \nNetflix has a lot of advantages in term of L2 language learning. There are some reasons such \nas the students enjoy watching movies and series in Netflix. So, indirectly they also learn \nEnglish from the conversation in movies and series in Netflix. Some students said that movies \nand series in Netflix use a lot of slang words so, they can learn slang word more than from a \ntextual book in the classroom. Netflix also help them used to listen some real word accents \nfrom native speakers. In contrast, the third question gave us the informants\u2019 point of views \nabout the disadvantages of Netflix. They stated that some Netflix English movies or series do \nnot have any filters for rude words. They think that not all of English movies and series in \nNetflix are really suitable for learning Media.  \nAfterward, the fourth and the fifth questions will strengthen the answers of \nquestionnaires about the learning effectiveness on students\u2019 listening and speaking skills in \ntable 8 and 9. From the interview transcript, it was found that most of the students answer that \nNetflix really helps them to get used to listen to the native speakers and also help them to \nlearn the different accents all around the world. Although, one student answers that if the \nmovies or series she watch in Netflix use British or another new accents she just knew, she \nfound it quite difficult to understand. For the last question, it was demonstrated that Netflix \nalso helps students in improving their speaking skill. Moreover, English movies and series in \nNetflix helps them become more confidence in speaking English. This is because they got \nmore exposure on the authentic English conversations. Netflix helps student to apply correct \npronunciation and help the speak fluently. However one student answer that Netflix has no \nsignificant benefit in her speaking skill because some of the terms and vocabularies used in \nNetflix are not really used in a formal learning. \n \nDiscussion \nBased on the first item in questionnaire results, both from the listening and speaking \nparts presented that mostly participants tend to agree and strongly agree that English movies \nor series in Netflix can learn and apply correct pronunciation. This is in line with the study \nfrom Ulfa (2017) which showed that movie is effective in improving students\u2019 pronunciation \nabilities. It was proved by the mean score of post-test which was higher than the pre-test. For \nthe second item, students\u2019 assume that they can understand and apply unfamiliar accents and \ndialects better through English movies or series in Netflix. This is strengthened by Stewart \nand Pertusa (2004) study result which stated that authentic speech in films or movies can \nmade EFL gaining faster understanding about unfamiliar accents. In contrast, Pourhosein \n(2016) stated that lot of exposure to spoken messages in authentic forms from the movies can \nmake people more understand easier familiar accents rather than unfamiliar accents.  \nThe next item is how students\u2019 perception tend to believe that they can enrich their \nnew vocabularies by using English movies or series in Netflix. This is because by watching \nmovies students often hear new words that they may never hear before. Students could also \nadd some vocabularies to their memory through listening and watching the scenes in the \nEnglish Movie (Simamora & Oktaviani, 2020). Watching movies in the original version is \nuseful for improving English language learning, learning natural speech and colloquial \nvocabulary, which are necessary when communicating with native speakers. Moreover, \nwatching English movies also helped students with A2 level can smoothly perceived any kind \nof various colloquial expressions, idioms, proverbs and lots of jokes in authentic forms \n(Samadova & Erkinov, 2023). \nMaharani, Jayanti, & Afifi \nPromoting Self-Directed Learning \u2026\u2026\u2026.. \n \nJOLLT Journal of Languages and Language Teaching, January 2024. Vol.12, No.1   | 223  \n \nAfterward, the item result showed students\u2019 perception about whether Netflix can \nimprove their listening skill better than other digital aid. Mostly participants chose agree and \nstrongly agree with the item. This is in line with the result of study by Ananda et al. (2021) \nwho did a comparative study between the use of Netflix and another digital aid to improve \nstudents\u2019 comprehension skills. It was found that those two digital aids can help students \nenhance their listening skills. However, the number of improvement of the Netflix was higher \nthan the other digital learning media. This proves that Netflix can help improving students\u2019 \nlistening comprehension skill better than others. For the last item in listening questionnaire \npart, the students\u2019 perceptions tend to agree and strongly agree that their listening skills are \nimproving by watching English movies or series in Netflix. This was also found by Istifadah \net al. (2022) that students\u2019 listening comprehension skills can be increased by the use of \naudio-visual aid such as movies and videos.  \nFor the rest item results from the speaking questionnaire part, most of respondents \nassume that the motion pictures in Netflix can inspire them to practice English speaking in \ndaily conversation. It may be evident that the software of lively motion pictures contributes to \nstudents' vocabulary mastery. Then the vocabulary mastery can help students easily recognize \nthe given words and inspire them to speak because they learn by using animated videos which \nis not only display written words but also pictures (Siregar et al., 2021). For the rest two items \nin speaking parts, namely English movies can enhance speaking skill and Netflix helps \nimproving speaking skills better, it was rarely found the study about this. However, Cakir \n(2006) reported that videos provide authentic language inputs that allow learners to \nexperience more effective language acquisition atmosphere. These authentic environments are \nquite valuable since they provide real objects, individuals, and circumstances which help to \ncomprehend real context regarding different life situations. Thus, it can be predicted helping \nstudents speaking skills immediately.  \nDizon (2018) conducted a study on video streaming but in the context of a paid \nstreaming service, specifically Netflix. According to the interview data, participants in the \nstudy thought the streaming service was motivating and useful for L2 English learning. This \nis in line with the interview session results that Netflix is such a fresh, fun, interesting L2 \nlearning media and also easy to use. Netflix has also a lot of advantages as well in the term of \nL2 language learning. However, I contrast with the advantages, some participants stated some \ndisadvantages of Netflix, namely, there is no sensor system for rude words in some movies. \nThus, not all of English movies and series can be used as a learning media for students. Dizon \n(2018) also stated on his research about the disadvantages of Netflix. But the results were \ndifferent with the researcher results in this study. Dizon found the Netflix disadvantages is \nonly about the cost and data restrictions.  \nIn a pilot study of Netflix, Alm (2021) examined how the interdependent nature of \nformal and informal learning\u2014a term she refers to as intra-formal learning\u2014impacted the \nlearning of L2 German. Based on data she collected from reflective reports, Alm concluded \nthat the video streaming service supported the participants\u2019 engagement in out-of-class \nlistening activities and promoted their metacognitive awareness. The aforementioned \nliterature demonstrates that on-screen textual aids can be beneficial for vocabulary learning \nand listening comprehension when watching L2 videos. This is in line with the interview \nresults that mostly of the respondents stated English movies and series in Netflix bring them \nimprovements in listening and speaking comprehension. \n \nCONCLUSION  \nBased on the findings and discussion, the results of the questionnaire and interview \nshow that English Education Department students of UIN Maulana Malik Ibrahim Malang \nhave positive perception and believe that Netflix as digital L2 learning aid can be beneficial \nMaharani, Jayanti, & Afifi \nPromoting Self-Directed Learning \u2026\u2026\u2026.. \n \nJOLLT Journal of Languages and Language Teaching, January 2024. Vol.12, No.1   | 224  \n \nfor their improvement of listening and speaking comprehension skills. They believe it is an \neffective L2 learning media more than other media normally used in the class. With an audio-\nvisual media such as English movies and series in Netflix, students are easier to understand \nthe language in context of several kinds of conversation because it can stimulate them to see \nand hear the video simultaneously. \n \nREFERENCES \nAlm, A.

This demographic dominates streaming platforms, \nso understanding factors influencing subscription willingness is crucial in the \ndigital entertainment industry. The study analyzes variables such as Perceived \nUsefulness, Perceived Ease of Use, Content Richness, Interactivity, and \nPerceived Price from the perspective of Generation Z in Indonesia. Utilizing the \nStructural Model with Partial Least Squares (PLS), online questionnaires were \ndistributed through social media, garnering 300 responses. Findings reveal that \nPerceived Price, Perceived Usefulness, and Perceived Ease of Use significantly \ninfluence the Willingness to subscribe to Netflix among Generation Z in \nIndonesia. Interactivity positively impacts Perceived Usefulness, while Content \nRichness lacks a significant influence. These results underscore the importance \nfor streaming providers like Netflix to ensure perceived value in pricing, prioritize \nuser-friendliness, and leverage interactive features for an enhanced subscription \nexperience. Aligning content with user preferences remains crucial for a nuanced \nunderstanding of the content-user relationship within the digital landscape, and \nthis research introduces novelty by delving deeper into Generation Z's distinctive \nviewpoints regarding Netflix services in Indonesia. \nKeywords: content richness, interactivity, willingness to subscribe, perceived \nprice, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use \n \nIntroduction \nIn the continually evolving digital era, communication and information \ntechnology have become primary drivers of change in how society accesses and \nenjoys entertainment (Naik, 2020). One significant transformation in the \nentertainment industry has occurred with the emergence of various online \nstreaming platforms. This is evident in the shifting habits of the public, moving \naway from conventional television shows and turning to online streaming services \nsuch as YouTube, Prime Video, and Netflix. This phenomenon is closely tied to \nthe adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology, which has begun to be \nintegrated into various operational activities in this industry (Agarwal et al., 2022; \nVerganti et al., 2020; Dwivedi et al., 2021). The capability of AI to enhance service \n \n \n \n                                                 Manajemen dan Bisnis, Volume 23, No 1 (March 2024) \n \nwww.journalmabis.org \n \n \n14 \nperformance efficiency, manage algorithms intelligently, and accurately \nunderstand consumer behavior has become a fundamental aspect of the \ntransformation in this industry (Javaid et al., 2022; Ma & Sun, 2020). \nAn example of an online streaming platform leveraging AI technology is \nNetflix. As one of the largest online streaming platforms globally, Netflix has \nsuccessfully integrated AI technology to increase the number of subscribers \nthrough an improved user experience (Song, 2021; Tibrewal et al., 2021). Netflix \nhas provided a more personalized and interactive experience, including \npersonalized content recommendations based on individual consumer behavior \nand improvements in search and navigation to ensure that consumers can easily \nfind preferred content. In their research, Tibrewal et al. (2021) explained that \nNetflix can analyze consumer behavior and provide subscription package \nrecommendations that align with their preferences. The significant adoption of AI \ntechnology by Netflix has transformed the services offered to consumers, \npotentially fostering emotional attachment with consumers (Puntoni et al., 2021). \nThis emotional connection ultimately influences consumers to continue \nsubscribing to Netflix's services. \nRetaining consumers on a platform is essential for any company, with direct \nimplications for maintaining stable company revenue (Al-zahrani, 2020). In other \nwords, retaining subscribers contributes to the business's sustainability by \nensuring a steady income. Furthermore, according to Kotler (2016), in his book \n\"The Principle of Marketing Strategy,\" a company can reduce its marketing costs \nby retaining subscribers. This is because the marketing cost to acquire new \ncustomers can be five times higher than the cost to retain existing ones (Kotler, \n2016). These implications underscore the absolute urgency to empirically \ninvestigate the willingness to subscribe more profoundly and comprehensively to \nNetflix's online streaming service, including the influencing factors. \n \nTable 1. The Netflix subscriber count from Q4 2021 to Q2 2023. \nYears \nUser Count \nQ4 2021 \n221,84 \nQ1 2022 \n221,64 \nQ2 2022 \n220,67 \nQ3 2022 \n223,09 \nQ4 2022 \n230,75 \nQ1 2023 \n232,5 \nQ2 2023 \n238,39 \nSource: Databoks, 2023 \n \nAccording to a survey conducted by the Populix survey agency and \nreleased in July 2022, Netflix maintains its position as Indonesia's most favored \nand widely used video-on-demand application (Databoks, 2022). However, \ndespite its popularity, Netflix has experienced a decline in subscribers during the \npost-pandemic period. This decline has been attributed to the government's \nrelaxation of social distancing policies, prompting individuals to resume normal \noutdoor activities. Consequently, the time spent on Netflix has decreased, leading \nconsumers to discontinue their subscriptions (Annur, 2023; Soldo & Schagerl, \n2023; Yesil, 2020). Additionally, the growing number of emerging online \nstreaming platforms has intensified competition within the industry (Mulla, 2022). \n \n \n \n                                                 Manajemen dan Bisnis, Volume 23, No 1 (March 2024) \n \nwww.journalmabis.org \n \n \n15 \nEach competitor strives to provide the best, distinct, unique, and impressive \nservices, offering consumers diverse choices (Lu & Siegfried, 2021). In response \nto these dynamics, companies are compelled to establish a competitive \nadvantage to differentiate themselves from competitors, ultimately enabling them \nto succeed in market competition and retain subscribers.   \nThe landscape of consumer subscription decisions in the digital age is \nintricately woven with considerations of costs and services. Gupta & Singharia \n(2021) assert that the interplay between incurred costs and received services \nsignificantly shapes consumer willingness to continue subscribing. In this context, \ncost pertains to the price consumers pay to access the service (Ngaraj et al., \n2021). Consumers are more likely to extend their subscription period when they \nperceive that the benefits outweigh the price paid (Lestari & Soesanto, 2020; \nMantymaki et al., 2020). In other words, the perceived price by consumers can \nimpact their willingness to subscribe to Netflix's online streaming service. This \nrelationship is supported by previous studies conducted by Gunawan (2022), \nHasan (2017), and Pritania et al. (2023), underscoring the significant influence of \nperceived price on the willingness to subscribe to online streaming services.   \nThe inconsistent findings regarding the relationship between perceived \nprice and willingness to subscribe add complexity to our understanding of \nconsumer behavior in online streaming services. Nugroho et al. (2019) challenge \nthe prevailing notion that perceived price uniformly dictates subscription \ndecisions. Their study reveals a divergence, suggesting that the influence of \nperceived price is not straightforward. According to Nugroho et al. (2019), \nconsumers in the online streaming landscape have distinct needs specifically met \nby individual platforms, diminishing the significance of price in their subscription \ndecisions. This nuanced perspective highlights a critical gap in existing research, \nsignaling that perceived price alone may not be the exclusive determinant of \nconsumer willingness to subscribe. Future investigations should consider these \nmultifaceted elements to enhance our understanding of digital subscription \ndecision-making. \nConsumers are more willing to extend their subscriptions when they \nperceive a service as highly useful or providing significant utility (Ahn & Lee, \n2019). This phenomenon reflects the subjective evaluation of consumers \nregarding the anticipated value of their subscription and its alignment with the \nincurred cost. Perceived usefulness fosters a perception of added value, \nheightening consumers' inclination to allocate their financial resources to desired \nbenefits (Tavitiyaman et al., 2022). Essentially, the higher the perceived \nusefulness by consumers, the more pronounced their willingness to extend their \nsubscriptions. This observation aligns with findings from studies conducted by \nPark et al. (2016), Gunawan (2022), and Kang et al. (2014).   \nIn the realm of online streaming services such as Netflix, the perceived utility \nis intricately tied to how well the service presents a variety of appealing content \nalternatives that align with consumers' needs and preferences (Adamczyk et al., \n2022). Through diverse content, users can discover material that resonates with \ntheir preferences, resulting in a gratifying viewing experience (Mantymaki et al., \n2020). This perception, in turn, acts as a catalyst or motivation for consumers to \nsustain their subscriptions to Netflix, as users perceive the subscription as \nproviding access to a service of elevated value and utility for meeting their \n \n \n \n                                                 Manajemen dan Bisnis, Volume 23, No 1 (March 2024) \n \nwww.journalmabis.org \n \n \n16 \nentertainment needs. The positive correlation between content richness and \nperceived usefulness is also in line with the findings of the study conducted by \nHarini et al. (2022). \n  Moreover, consumers' perception of the utility of an online streaming \nservice is significantly influenced by the level of interactivity the service offers \n(Camilleri & Falzon, 2021). When users can actively engage with the platform, \nthey are inclined to perceive it as more useful (Bacile, 2020). Bacile (2020) \nelucidated in their research that intelligent recommendation features and \npersonalized content empower a service platform to comprehend user \npreferences, presenting more relevant and engaging content. In the context of \nNetflix, this interactivity fosters a customized viewing experience tailored to \nindividual tastes, imparting significant added value to users. In essence, the \nhigher the interactivity provided by Netflix, the more elevated the consumer's \nperception of the platform's utility. This correlation also aligns with prior research \nby Cebeci et al. (2019) and Lestari & Soesanto (2020), which posit that \ninteractivity positively and significantly impacts perceived usefulness, ultimately \ninfluencing consumer willingness to continue subscribing to a platform.   \nThe degree of interactivity offered by Netflix indicates how effectively the \nplatform provides a user-friendly service to its consumers (Lengyel, 2021). \nConsumers who perceive the service as easy to use view subscribing to it as a \npractical and efficient choice (Etminani-Ghasrodashti, 2022). The simplicity of the \nsubscription process also creates a perception among consumers that accessing \ndesired content is more readily achievable without significant hurdles (Yaacob & \nMd Saad, 2020). Essentially, the more effortlessly consumers can navigate and \nutilize the service, the higher their willingness to subscribe. This correlation aligns \nwith the research findings conducted by Nugroho et al. (2019) and Pritania et al. \n(2023). \nThe aforementioned phenomenon can be comprehensively examined \nthrough the grand theory proposed by Davis (1989), known as The Technology \nAcceptance Model (TAM). This theory serves as the foundation for a widely \nutilized framework aimed at understanding and predicting users' acceptance and \nadoption of new technology. The model primarily centers on two key variables: \nperceived usefulness (PU) and perceived ease of use (PEOU). According to \nDavis (1989), perceived usefulness gauges the extent to which users believe \ntechnology will enhance their productivity or simplify their tasks. Additionally, \nDavis (1989) elucidates that perceived ease of use measures the extent to which \nusers believe the technology is easy to use. With a more profound understanding \nof customer preferences, Netflix can continually innovate, expand, and sustain its \nbusiness amidst growing competition by creating more captivating content that \naligns with integrating new technology. This research specifically focuses on \nexploring the subscription behavior of Generation Z towards Netflix.   \nPrevious research in this domain remains limited, primarily concentrating on \ndiverse generational perspectives without specifically delineating Generation Z. \nTherefore, this study introduces novelty by delving deeper into the distinctive \nviewpoints of Generation Z regarding Netflix services in Indonesia. In a report, it \nis noted that Gen Z exhibits a higher preference for watching movies online \ncompared to other generations, with a difference of approximately 27 percent. \nThis suggests that younger generations are more inclined to use streaming \n \n \n \n                                                 Manajemen dan Bisnis, Volume 23, No 1 (March 2024) \n \nwww.journalmabis.org \n \n \n17 \nservices more frequently. According to a survey by GWI, around 60% of \nGeneration Z individuals carefully consider various factors before opting for \nstreaming services, signifying a discerning approach in selecting services that \ncater to their needs. With a demographic that increasingly dominates the \nutilization of streaming platforms, gaining a profound understanding of the factors \ninfluencing their willingness to subscribe becomes crucial in the online streaming \nindustry. By introducing the variable of content richness, interactivity, perceived \nprice, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and willingness to subscribe \nto Generation Z as a focal point, this research aims to provide a comprehensive \nand novel perspective that contributes to bridging the existing gap in \nunderstanding the dynamics of the online streaming industry. \nThe diversity in media content, as elucidated by Park et al. (2016), can \npositively impact users' perceptions of the platform's utility. In essence, when \nusers encounter a variety of programs and films available on Netflix, they are \nmore inclined to perceive Netflix as a beneficial and relevant entertainment \nsolution that caters to their diverse entertainment preferences. The inherent \navailability of diverse content can inherently contribute to a positive influence on \nthe perception of a media's utility (Park et al., 2016); Tseng and Teng (2014); \nHasan, V. A. (2017); Gunawan, P. (2022), and Kang et al. (2014). With various \nchoices, users can customize their entertainment experience to align with their \npreferences, fostering an environment accommodating a diverse audience. This \naspect can be broadened on Netflix to include additional content, such as \ndocumentaries, TV shows, and various film genres. The greater the number of \noptions provided to users, the higher the potential to cultivate a robust relationship \nbetween individuals and the platform. Lee & Lehto (2012) also affirm that the \nmore diverse the content offered by a system, the more likely individuals are to \nperceive the system as something valuable. In the context of Netflix, the \nextensive diversity in content provided by this platform can enhance the \nPerception of Usefulness, as recognized in previous research. So, the hypothesis \nobtained: \nH1: Content richness has a positive and significant influence on perceived \nusefulness \nAccording to Liu and Shrum (2002), interactivity can be defined as the extent \nto which the potential for two-way communication occurs, either between \nindividuals or between an individual and a platform, when utilizing various types \nof communication media. Interactivity, within the context of technology or \nsystems, significantly influences perceived usefulness and can enhance user \nengagement in technology usage. When users feel actively involved in interaction \nwith technology, they are more inclined to utilize various features and \nfunctionalities offered, aiding them in achieving their goals more effectively. Wu \n(2006) identifies interactivity as an external factor influencing perceived \nusefulness (PU) in technological innovation. Studies by Park et al. (2016) and \nKang et al. (2014) also observe a positive impact of interactivity on perceived \nusefulness in their research on IPTV. Another study by Teo (2003) investigates \nthe effect of the level of interactivity on user attitudes toward commercial \nwebsites, supporting the notion that interactivity has a positive impact on user \nattitudes toward websites, which can be interpreted as an increase in usefulness. \nSo, the hypothesis obtained: \n \n \n \n                                                 Manajemen dan Bisnis, Volume 23, No 1 (March 2024) \n \nwww.journalmabis.org \n \n \n18 \nH2: Interactivity has a positive and significant influence on perceived usefulness  \nAccording to Liou et al. (2015), the perception of price, or perceived price, \nsignificantly influences consumers. When the price of a product/service exceeds \nthe benefits derived from it, it can impact how customers, as consumers, adopt \nthat service. Consumer perceptions of price also play a substantial role in \nassessing a product's quality and value (Zeithaml, 1988). Therefore, price serves \nas a crucial indicator in consumers' evaluations of the quality of a product/service. \nIf customers feel that the subscription price for Netflix is too high, they may \nchoose not to subscribe. However, if they perceive that the price offered on the \nNetflix platform aligns with the value and benefits they receive, they are more \nlikely to subscribe. Fletcher (2020) found that individuals with higher \nentertainment expenditures are more willing to pay for subscriptions, indicating a \npositive correlation between spending and the desire to subscribe. Research \n(Gunawan, 2022) also asserts that perceived price positively and significantly \nimpacts the willingness to subscribe to video streaming applications. So, the \nhypothesis obtained: \nH3: Perceived Price has a positive and significant influence on Willingness to \nSubscribe  \nThe perceived usefulness experienced by consumers is believed to exert a \npositive influence on individual subscription interest in Netflix. This perceived \nusefulness illustrates the extent to which users (consumers) perceive the benefits \nand utility of using the service in their lives and adopting the service will enhance \nthe effectiveness and performance of the users. When users perceive that Netflix \noffers high perceived usefulness, including valuable features, quality content, and \naccessibility anytime, anywhere, they are more likely to subscribe to Netflix. \nLeong et al. (2011) demonstrate that perceived usefulness positively impacts the \nintention to adopt mobile entertainment. Additionally, perceived usefulness \nsignificantly influences the intention to use online platforms for watching movies \n(Basuki et al., 2021). A cause-and-effect relationship exists between perceived \nusefulness and the willingness to subscribe (Park et al., 2016). Research \nconducted by Hasan (2017), Gunawan (2022), and Kang et al. (2014) also \nyielded similar results, indicating that perceived usefulness positively influences \nthe willingness to subscribe to media or video streaming applications. So, the \nhypothesis obtained: \nH4: Perceived usefulness has a positive and significant influence on Willingness \nto subscribe  \nAccording to Sathye (1999), perceived ease of use influences consumers' \ninterest in using a service and indicates their willingness to subscribe. In the \ncontext of Netflix, perceived ease of use refers to the extent to which individual \nconsumers believe that using the Netflix platform will not require extra effort and \nwill be free from difficulties. The perception of ease of use on Netflix can be \nobserved in various aspects, such as the ease of operating the system/features, \nsearching for content, and during actual usage. Perceived ease of use (PEOU) \nsignificantly impacts the intention to use online platforms for watching movies \n(Basuki et al., 2021). Several studies have found that perceived ease of use \nsignificantly influences subscription intentions, as indicated by Pritania & Mulia \n(2023), Kang et al. (2014), and Hasan (2017). Hasan (2017) also asserts that the \nperception of ease of use positively affects the willingness to subscribe to a movie \n \n \n \n                                                 Manajemen dan Bisnis, Volume 23, No 1 (March 2024) \n \nwww.journalmabis.org \n \n \n19 \nstreaming application. So, the hypothesis obtained:     \nH5: Perceived Ease of Use has a positive and significant influence on Willingness \nto subscribe of Gen Z on Netflix. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 1. Research Conceptual \n \nResearch Methods \nThis research adopts a quantitative-explanatory approach, focusing on the \npopulation of Generation Z Netflix subscribers in Indonesia. The exact size of this \npopulation cannot be precisely determined. To determine the sample size, the \nstudy employs a purposive sampling technique, referencing the formula \nexplained by Hair et al. (2019). This formula multiplies the number of variable \ncategories by 5, 10, 15, and 20. Following this formula, the total number of \nsamples taken in this research is 300 respondents. An online questionnaire was \ndistributed through all the researcher's social media channels and various other \nonline platforms, with specific sampling criteria applied: respondents must be \nNetflix users in Indonesia, aged between 11-26 years (Generation Z), and have \nsubscribed to the Netflix app at least once. Data collection in this research utilizes \nan online questionnaire distributed through the Google Form platform, employing \na Likert scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). The data \nanalysis method used in this research involves descriptive statistical analysis and \nSEM-PLS analysis, assisted by SmartPLS 4 software. Given that this research \nexplores relationships among various factors influencing Generation Z's \nwillingness to subscribe to Netflix, SEM-PLS provides a flexible and effective tool \nfor modeling such complexity. Three stages are performed in the SEM-PLS \nanalysis: outer model analysis, inner model analysis, and hypothesis testing (Hair \net al., 2019). \n \nResult and Discussions \nThe characteristics of respondents reveal a notable representation of the \nolder segment of Generation Z, aged 21-26, in their preferences for watching \nfilms on Netflix compared to the younger segment of Generation Z. This \nobservation can be attributed to the greater independence and accessibility to \ndevices, such as smartphones and computers, among the older Generation Z. \nThese factors enable them to exercise more control over their entertainment \n \n \n \n                                                 Manajemen dan Bisnis, Volume 23, No 1 (March 2024) \n \nwww.journalmabis.org \n \n \n20 \ncontent choices, rendering them more inclined to subscribe to streaming services. \nThe older Generation Z cohort has also developed a more mature and diverse \ntaste in films, contributing to their active exploration of various content on Netflix. \nAdditionally, their increased financial independence may contribute to \nsubscribing to services like Netflix, possibly stemming from personal income or \nfinancial support.   \n \nTable 2.

Notably, females often lean \ntowards genres such as drama, romance, and comedy, which resonate more with \ntheir preferences. The data underscores the substantial percentage of \nrespondents selecting these genres for viewing. Additionally, females actively \nshare film recommendations on social media, with suggestions from friends or \ninfluencers they follow exerting an influential role in shaping their viewing choices. \nLastly, females may allocate a higher proportion of their leisure time to watching \nfilms than males. The confluence of these factors collectively elucidates the \nhigher film consumption rate among females.   \nMost respondents in this study belong to Generation Z, particularly \nstudents. This prevalence may be attributed to students having more leisure time \nthan the working generation, potentially benefiting from a more flexible schedule \nthat allows for pursuits such as watching Netflix. Additionally, students typically \npossess advanced skills in using electronic devices, including those employed \nfor streaming services, increasing the likelihood of having access to platforms like \nNetflix. Research specifically targeting Generation Z is likely to attract \nrespondents from this age group, predominantly students.

Those dedicating 4-6 hours to watching films likely have more leisure \ntime than light users and enjoy diverse content. Meanwhile, users devoting 7-9 \nhours or more to Netflix viewing can be classified as \"Happy Users\" who derive \nsignificant enjoyment from this form of entertainment. They either appreciate the \nplatform's diverse content or use it to fill their leisure time with films and TV shows. \nThe factors influencing time usage encompass individual needs, preferences, \nand time availability, showcasing variations in preferences and lifestyles among \ndifferent Netflix users.  \n A predominant portion of Generation Z utilizes their smartphones to watch \nNetflix due to the high portability of these devices, enabling users to enjoy Netflix \ncontent anywhere and at any time. This convenience is particularly beneficial for \non-the-go entertainment or during travel. Moreover, as individuals typically keep \ntheir phones easily accessible, accessing Netflix becomes exceptionally \nconvenient without needing an additional device. Acknowledging that viewing \ndevice preferences may vary across different generations is crucial. Generation \nZ's immersion in digital technology makes them more inclined to use phones for \nentertainment, considering them a familiar and comfortable device, even with \nsmaller screens. Conversely, Generation Y and older generations may prefer \ndevices with larger screens like laptops, tablets, or TVs to enhance their viewing \nexperience with a more extensive and detailed display. \nThis study employed Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) with Partial Least \nSquares (PLS), supported by SmartPLS 4 software, for data analysis. The \nresearch model underwent evaluation through three stages: outer model \nanalysis, inner model analysis, and hypothesis testing for the study constructs. \nThe outer model analysis aimed to assess the validity and reliability of latent \nvariable constructs. Validity was determined by examining the factor loading \nvalues, with indicators considered valid and robust if the loading factor \ncoefficients exceeded 0.6. This criterion applied to all loading factor values for the \nmeasured construct variables. Table 4 illustrates that the reflective \nmeasurements in this study demonstrated high validity, as indicated by significant \ncorrelation values for each item in all variables. All these items exhibited factor \nloading values exceeding 0.60 for the evaluated construct variables, suggesting \nthat all research items are valid and strongly associated. The validity test results \nreceived further support through the Average Variance Extracted (AVE) test, \nwhich specifies that indicators in this study are considered valid if the AVE values \nsurpass 0.50. This criterion is consistent with prior research by Hair et al. (2019) \nand Ghozali and Latan (2012). In this study, all variables\u2014content richness, \ninteractivity, perceived price, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and \nwillingness to subscribe\u2014displayed AVE values exceeding 0.50, confirming their \nvalidity. \nThe convergent validity of the external model measurement is evaluated \nthrough three distinct approaches. Firstly, each Average Variance Extracted \n(AVE) for the constructs surpasses the threshold of 0.5, confirming satisfactory \nconvergence. Secondly, each construct's Composite Reliability (CoR) must \nexceed 0.7 to be considered robust and reliable. Lastly, the factor loadings are \nrecommended to exceed 0.7 to meet optimal standards and indicate a strong \nlevel of convergent validity (Hair, 2019). \n \n \n \n                                                 Manajemen dan Bisnis, Volume 23, No 1 (March 2024) \n \nwww.journalmabis.org \n \n \n23 \nTable 4.

Contrary to the expectations derived from the Technology \nAcceptance Model (TAM) and previous studies (Park et al., 2016; Tseng and \nTeng, 2014; Hasan, 2017; Gunawan, 2022; and Kang et al., 2014), Content \nRichness does not exhibit a significant effect on Perceived Usefulness. \nThis deviation can be interpreted by scrutinizing the nuanced interplay \nbetween the variety of content offered by Netflix and individual user preferences. \nDespite Netflix's provision of a diverse range of content encompassing movies, \nseries, and documentaries across various genres, the user experience seems to \nhinge on the alignment of this diversity with individual preferences. The loading \nfactor values for the Content Richness variable substantiate this observation, with \nthe indicator related to content diversity (CR.1) exhibiting the highest value \namong other indicators. In essence, while consumers acknowledge the platform's \ndiverse content, this diversity alone does not necessarily alter their perception of \nNetflix's usefulness. \nA crucial insight derived from this finding is that consumers, particularly \nthose with low perceived usefulness, may perceive that the platform does not \nadequately meet their needs despite the diverse content offerings. This \ndiscrepancy challenges the conventional belief in the positive relationship \nbetween Content Richness and Perceived Usefulness within the context of online \nstreaming services, as suggested by previous studies. The research indicates \nthat, for platforms like Netflix, the mere provision of diverse content may not \nenhance perceived usefulness, emphasizing the importance of aligning content \ndiversity with individual user preferences for a more personalized and impactful \nuser experience. \n The identified positive and significant relationship between interactivity (IA) \nand perceived usefulness (PU) on Netflix is a robust cornerstone, enabling users \nto extract maximum benefits from this streaming platform. The magnitude of \ninteractivity directly correlates with the potential for users to perceive Netflix as \nan exceedingly helpful service. This heightened interactivity is exemplified \nthrough Netflix's implementation of algorithmic systems adept at discerning \nconsumer preferences, fostering the perception that Netflix is a valuable \nstreaming service platform. \nThe active engagement facilitated by the platform, mainly through users' \ninteractions with the algorithmic systems, reinforces the notion that Netflix is an \n \n \n \n                                                 Manajemen dan Bisnis, Volume 23, No 1 (March 2024) \n \nwww.journalmabis.org \n \n \n26 \nefficient and effective tool for satisfying entertainment needs. This sentiment is \nunderscored by the highest outer loading value associated with indicator IA.6, \nemphasizing the system's proficiency in complying with consumer commands. \nThese findings align with and reinforce prior research conducted by Park et al. \n(2016) and Kang et al. (2014), which corroborate that interactivity positively \nimpacts perceived usefulness. \nThe positive relationship between interactivity and perceived usefulness \nelucidates the pivotal role of user engagement and the platform's responsiveness \nin shaping users' perceptions of Netflix as a valuable and beneficial streaming \nservice. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the dynamics \nbetween interactivity and perceived usefulness within online streaming platforms, \nemphasizing the importance of interactive features in enhancing user satisfaction \nand utility. \nThe identified positive and significant relationship between perceived price \nand willingness to subscribe on Netflix underscores a crucial dynamic: users are \nmore inclined to subscribe when they perceive that the subscription cost aligns \nwith the value they receive. When users believe that the price paid corresponds \nto the quality of content, diverse content choices, and additional features offered, \ntheir likelihood to subscribe increases substantially. This positive and significant \nrelationship indicates that a well-considered pricing strategy that aligns with the \nperceived value provided by the service can strongly influence users' subscription \ndecisions. \nIf Netflix successfully delivers high-quality content and desirable features at \nan affordable subscription price, it fosters a positive perception among users. \nWhen accompanied by corresponding perceived value, an increase in perceived \nprice becomes a critical factor in enhancing users' willingness to subscribe and \ncultivate loyalty. These findings resonate with Fletcher's (2020) and Gunawan's \n(2022) research, reinforcing that the interplay between perceived price and value \nis pivotal in shaping users' decisions to subscribe and engage with streaming \nservices. \nThe established positive and significant relationship between perceived \nusefulness and willingness to subscribe on the Netflix service platform \nunderscores the pivotal role of perceived utility in influencing users' subscription \ndecisions. Perceived usefulness captures the extent to which users perceive the \nservice as an effective and beneficial tool in meeting their needs and preferences. \nWhen users perceive the platform as offering significant benefits, easy access to \nhigh-quality and diverse content, and the ability to meet their expectations, their \nwillingness to subscribe experiences a notable boost. \nPerceived usefulness instills confidence among users that subscribing will \nfurnish added value and solutions aligned with their entertainment needs. The \npositive findings regarding the relationship between perceived usefulness and \nwillingness to subscribe align harmoniously with prior research conducted by \nHasan (2017), Gunawan (2022), and Kang et al. (2014). This consistency in \nresults across studies reinforces the notion that the perceived utility of a \nstreaming service is a critical determinant in users' decisions to subscribe, \nsignifying its significance in the dynamic landscape of online streaming platforms. \nThe observed positive and significant relationship between perceived ease \nof use and willingness to subscribe in subscription services, exemplified by \n \n \n \n                                                 Manajemen dan Bisnis, Volume 23, No 1 (March 2024) \n \nwww.journalmabis.org \n \n \n27 \nplatforms like Netflix, underscores the substantial influence of ease of use on \nusers' subscription intentions. Perceived ease of use encompasses how users \nperceive the subscription process\u2014whether it is simple, fast, and uncomplicated. \nA high perceived ease of use can instill confidence in users that accessing and \nenjoying the service will be straightforward, without unnecessary complexities. \nThe desire to subscribe is heightened because the process is perceived as time-\nefficient and devoid of frustration. \nThe positive and significant relationship established in this context positions \nenhancing user-friendliness as a strategic avenue to boost subscription intent. By \nprioritizing and optimizing the ease of use, subscription services like Netflix can \nencourage more users to consider and commit to subscriptions. These findings \nfind support in research conducted by Pritania & Mulia (2023), Kang et al. (2014), \nand Hasan (2017), further validating the importance of perceived ease of use in \nshaping users' willingness to subscribe to online streaming services. \nThe research findings have several significant theoretical implications. The \nidentified relationship between content richness (CR) and perceived usefulness \n(PU) underscores the complexity of the connection between content and user \nperceptions, yielding novel insights distinct from prior research. User preference \nvariability and the constant evolution of content by Netflix may obscure this \nrelationship. Additionally, external factors such as competition with other \nstreaming platforms and industry trends may also influence how users assess the \nusefulness of content. The results indicating a positive and significant influence \nof interactivity (IA) on perceived usefulness (PU) provide strong support for the \nimportance of interactive features in enhancing user experience on streaming \nplatforms like Netflix. Theoretical implications affirm previous research findings \nand highlight how user participation can enhance perceptions of product \nusefulness. \nFrom a managerial standpoint, the finding that perceived price (PP) is \npositively and significantly related to willingness to subscribe (WTS) offers crucial \nguidance for streaming service providers like Netflix. Improving customer \nperception of pricing commensurate with the benefits provided is critical to \nmotivating and retaining subscribers. Moreover, results indicating the positive \nand significant influence of perceived usefulness (PU) and perceived ease of use \n(PEOU) on willingness to subscribe (WTS) underscore the importance of \nensuring that streaming services like Netflix are user-friendly and beneficial. This \nimplies the importance of providing a user-friendly interface, features supporting \nefficient content search and recommendations, and responsive customer service \nto maintain and attract new customers. \nThis research contributes innovative knowledge by exploring the \nsubscription willingness of Generation Z, a dominant and frequent streaming \nservice user. Understanding Generation Z's preferences and behaviors regarding \nstreaming services can inform future business strategies. Expanding content \naligns with their preferences, developing interactive features, and leveraging \nsocial media marketing can be considered. Companies should also prioritize \nenhancing user experience, utilizing data analytics, and collaborating with \npopular content creators among Generation Z. \n \n \n \n \n                                                 Manajemen dan Bisnis, Volume 23, No 1 (March 2024) \n \nwww.journalmabis.org \n \n \n28 \nConclusion \nIn summarizing the findings of this research, the analysis reveals several \nkey insights related to the factors influencing customers' willingness to subscribe \nto Netflix services. Firstly, the relationship between content richness (CR) and \nperceived usefulness (PU) was identified as positive, although not statistically \nsignificant. This highlights the complexity of measuring the correlation between \ncontent variability and usefulness perceptions in the context of Netflix. On the \nother hand, interactivity (IA) demonstrated a strong and significant influence on \nperceived usefulness, enhancing customer satisfaction. Furthermore, perceived \nprice (PP) was also found to have a positive and significant association with \ncustomers' willingness to subscribe to Netflix, indicating that the subscription \nprice is perceived as commensurate with the benefits provided. \nLastly, perceived usefulness (PU) and perceived ease of use (PEOU) also \nexhibited positive and significant effects on the willingness to subscribe, aligning \nwith the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) theory on technology adoption. \nThese findings suggest that users who perceive Netflix services as beneficial and \neasy to use are more inclined to subscribe. These results provide valuable \ninsights into the factors influencing customer decisions in the context of streaming \nservices such as Netflix. \nFuture research is recommended to identify different customer segments \nconcerning their willingness to subscribe to Netflix. Whether there are significant \ndifferences between generations, viewing preferences, or price preferences. It is \nsuggested for further research to utilize qualitative research methods to \nunderstand customer motivations in subscribing to this service. Consider aspects \nthat have not been extensively elaborated, such as entertainment, convenience, \npersonalized recommendations, or exclusivity in Netflix content offerings that \nmay motivate customers to subscribe to this service. \n \nAcknowledgments   \nPraise and gratitude to the presence of Allah SWT for all His blessings and \nmercies that are continually bestowed upon all of His creatures.

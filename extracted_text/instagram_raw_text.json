Int J Behav Nutr Phys Act           (2024) 21:16 \nIntroduction\nPoor diet quality is the leading preventable risk factor \ncontributing to the global burden of non-communica-\nble disease [1]. Dietary behaviours are complex and are \ninfluenced by a range of factors, including hunger, taste \npreferences, food availability, price, societal norms, and \npolicy context [2]. Nutrition information environments, \nwhich encompass the media and advertising, can also \nexert an influence on dietary behaviours [2]. Social media \nhas recently become a prominent part of the modern \nmedia environment and is a popular vehicle for advertis-\ning, marketing and information sharing. Fifty-nine per-\ncent of the global population are active on social media, \n[3] and social media advertising revenue was projected to \nreach $173 billion USD in 2022 [4]. Food and nutrition \nare popular topics on social media platforms, [5, 6] and \nmarketing of food and supplement products has become \nprolific [7, 8]. There is a growing body of evidence that \nindicates food and nutrition content and marketing \non social media has the power to influence food choice \n[9\u201312].\nAs the Internet has become more accessible, individu-\nals have increasingly utilised it to source information \nabout nutrition. Consumers seek nutrition information \nfor various reasons including health management, curi-\nosity, and interest\u00a0 [13]. Nutrition information is con-\ntent that provides the general public with guidance on \nsourcing, storing, preparing and consuming food to sup-\nport good health, and includes recipes, product details, \nhealthy-eating advice and nutritional requirements \n(defined in full in Table\u00a01). Increases in online nutrition \ninformation seeking behaviour have been observed in \nAmerica, [14] Canada, [15] France, [16] and Norway, [17] \nand the Internet is the primary source of nutrition infor-\nmation for Australians [18, 19]. Social media has become \na ubiquitous part of the Internet and consumers search \nfor and follow food and nutrition-related content on \nsocial media [6, 20\u201322]. A survey of American Instagram \nusers found that 87% of female users followed nutrition-\nrelated content on the platform [6]. Consumers not only \nseek information about food and nutrition on social \nmedia they are also passively exposed to it in their social \nmedia feeds without intentionally searching for it [23, \n24]. Due to the influence of social media algorithms and \npaid sponsorships, social media users are also presented \nwith content in their feed from entities that they do not \nfollow. Furthermore, content can be published by anyone, \nregardless of their qualifications, level of expertise in the \ntopic or conflicting interests.\nAccurate and high-quality information is essential \nfor effective health communication and promotion. In \nhealth communication literature, accuracy refers to \nhealth information\u2019s factual correctness, and quality \nrefers to information\u2019s reliability when assessed using \ndefined quality criteria (see Table\u00a0 1) [25, 26]. Quality \nand accuracy are two important but distinct compo-\nnents of information\u2019s overall reliability. It is possible \nfor information to be accurate but of low quality and \nvice versa. Previous studies have assessed the accu-\nracy of online nutrition information against authorita-\ntive sources such as dietary guidelines, authoritative \nreports and peer reviewed literature [25]. Numerous \nquality assessment tools have been used to evaluate \nthe quality of online nutrition information, such as the \nDISCERN Instrument, [27]. Journal of the American \nMedical Association Benchmarks, [28] and Health on \nthe Net Code Principles [7, 29]. These tools share com-\nmon quality criteria, such as, declaring financial inter-\nests, citing sources, authorship by an individual with \nrelevant health-related qualifications, and disclosure of \nthe author\u2019s qualifications. Principles for Health-related \nInformation on Social Media (PRHISM), is a recently \ndeveloped quality assessment tool, which includes \nthese established quality principles and additional \nprinciples that are relevant to social media, including \naccessibility and readability [30]. There is a broad con-\nsensus in the literature that health information of sub-\noptimal quality and accuracy is extremely prevalent on \nsocial media [26, 31]. Concerningly, misinformation is \noften more popular than truthful information, receives \nhigher user engagement and spreads more quickly than \nthe truth due to its novelty [31, 32]. Furthermore, the \nnarrative of health misinformation often includes and \npromotes mistrust in authoritative institutions and \nTable\u202f1\u2002 Key definitions\na From Denniss et\u00a0al. [25]\nAccuracy: The factual correctness of\u00a0information when\u00a0compared to\u00a0authoritative sources of\u00a0information such as\u00a0systematic reviews, meta analyses \nor\u00a0national dietary guidelines [25].\nQuality: The reliability of\u00a0information as\u00a0assessed by\u00a0quality criteria [26]. Quality criteria typically include components such as\u00a0readability, inclusion of\u00a0ref-\nerences, transparency about\u00a0financial interests and\u00a0disclosure of\u00a0the\u00a0author\u2019s identity and\u00a0qualifications\naNutrition-related information: information regarding\u00a0healthy eating, dietary patterns, nutrients, nutritional requirements, nutritional composition \nof\u00a0foods, nutritional supplements, health outcomes associated with\u00a0foods and\u00a0dietary patterns, food safety, food ethics, cooking and\u00a0recipes intended \nfor\u00a0the\u00a0general public [25].\n"

In \nhealth communication literature, accuracy refers to \nhealth information\u2019s factual correctness, and quality \nrefers to information\u2019s reliability when assessed using \ndefined quality criteria (see Table\u00a0 1) [25, 26]. Quality \nand accuracy are two important but distinct compo-\nnents of information\u2019s overall reliability. It is possible \nfor information to be accurate but of low quality and \nvice versa. Previous studies have assessed the accu-\nracy of online nutrition information against authorita-\ntive sources such as dietary guidelines, authoritative \nreports and peer reviewed literature [25]. Numerous \nquality assessment tools have been used to evaluate \nthe quality of online nutrition information, such as the \nDISCERN Instrument, [27]. Journal of the American \nMedical Association Benchmarks, [28] and Health on \nthe Net Code Principles [7, 29]. These tools share com-\nmon quality criteria, such as, declaring financial inter-\nests, citing sources, authorship by an individual with \nrelevant health-related qualifications, and disclosure of \nthe author\u2019s qualifications. Principles for Health-related \nInformation on Social Media (PRHISM), is a recently \ndeveloped quality assessment tool, which includes \nthese established quality principles and additional \nprinciples that are relevant to social media, including \naccessibility and readability [30]. There is a broad con-\nsensus in the literature that health information of sub-\noptimal quality and accuracy is extremely prevalent on \nsocial media [26, 31]. Concerningly, misinformation is \noften more popular than truthful information, receives \nhigher user engagement and spreads more quickly than \nthe truth due to its novelty [31, 32]. Furthermore, the \nnarrative of health misinformation often includes and \npromotes mistrust in authoritative institutions and \nTable\u202f1\u2002 Key definitions\na From Denniss et\u00a0al. [25]\nAccuracy: The factual correctness of\u00a0information when\u00a0compared to\u00a0authoritative sources of\u00a0information such as\u00a0systematic reviews, meta analyses \nor\u00a0national dietary guidelines [25].\nQuality: The reliability of\u00a0information as\u00a0assessed by\u00a0quality criteria [26]. Quality criteria typically include components such as\u00a0readability, inclusion of\u00a0ref-\nerences, transparency about\u00a0financial interests and\u00a0disclosure of\u00a0the\u00a0author\u2019s identity and\u00a0qualifications\naNutrition-related information: information regarding\u00a0healthy eating, dietary patterns, nutrients, nutritional requirements, nutritional composition \nof\u00a0foods, nutritional supplements, health outcomes associated with\u00a0foods and\u00a0dietary patterns, food safety, food ethics, cooking and\u00a0recipes intended \nfor\u00a0the\u00a0general public [25].\nPage 3 of 14\nDenniss\u00a0et\u00a0al. Int J Behav Nutr Phys Act           (2024) 21:16 \n\t\nexperts [31]. Social media-based misinformation can \nhave consequences for public health, for example, the \nonline anti-vaccination movement is believed to have \ncontributed to a reduction in vaccination rates and the \nreemergence of previously eradicated communicable \ndiseases [31, 33].\nPublic health nutrition experts and organisations have \nraised concerns about the potential for nutrition-related \nmisinformation to cause serious harm and undermine \ncredible nutrition communication. Exposure to nutri-\ntion information that lacks context or contradicts previ-\nous messaging can lead to confusion and backlash, which \nhas been evidenced to reduce consumers\u2019 willingness \nto engage in healthful behaviours and accept advice by \nauthoritative nutrition experts [34, 35]. If dietary behav-\niours are based on misinformation that contradicts evi-\ndence-based dietary guidelines, it may put individuals at \ngreater risk of developing non-communicable diseases \nthat are associated with unhealthy dietary patterns [1]. A \nrecent systematic review of studies evaluating the quality \nand accuracy of nutrition-related information published \non websites and social media found that generally infor-\nmation was of suboptimal quality and accuracy [25]. A \nsmall number of studies in the review investigated cer-\ntain social media (e.g., blogs, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter \nand WhatsApp), meaning other platforms, such as Insta-\ngram have had limited attention [25]. A further limitation \nwas that quality assessment tools designed for different \nsettings, for example, websites, were used to evaluate the \nsocial media content [25]. Furthermore, it was also rare \nfor studies to involve multiple researchers when screen-\ning posts to evaluate, which is a potential source of bias \n[25]. One recent study that was not captured within the \ndate-range of the systematic review examined the qual-\nity of nutrition-related information on Instagram find-\ning that quality was extremely low [36]. However, this \nstudy measured quality as a single criterion, rather than \nusing an extensive quality assessment method, and thus \nmay not have comprehensively measured the quality of \ninformation.\nTo the knowledge of the authors, thus far no studies \nhave assessed the accuracy of nutrition information on \nInstagram, and none have used social media specific tools \nto evaluate the quality of nutrition-related Instagram \ncontent. Instagram was the third most popular social \nmedia platform in Australia, and the fifth most visited \nwebsite in the world in 2021, [3,\u00a037] and nutrition is one \nof the most frequently discussed health topics on Insta-\ngram [5]. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evalu-\nate the quality and accuracy of nutrition information \nposted by popular Australian Instagram accounts using \nthe PRHISM tool to assess quality. A secondary aim was \nto examine trends in information quality and accuracy by \nauthor, topic, post engagement, account verification and \nnumber of followers.\nMethods\nStudy design and\u00a0data collection\nThe present study involved a cross-sectional evaluation \nof the quality and accuracy of nutrition-related infor-\nmation published on Instagram by Australian influencer \nor brand accounts. The Strengthening the Reporting of \nObservational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guide-\nlines were followed and the checklist is available in Sup-\nplementary Table\u00a01 [38]. A subsample of Instagram posts \ncollected for a wider project formed the dataset for this \nstudy and data collection has been described in detail \nelsewhere [7]. Briefly, a list of the top 1,000 Australian \nhealth Instagram accounts as of April 2021 was screened \nto determine eligibility [39]. Australian accounts with \nover 100,000 followers, a minimum of 100 posts, their \nmost recent post published within two weeks, and a \nminimum of 25% of their content relating to nutrition \nwere included. The figure of 100,000 followers was cho-\nsen because accounts with over 100,000 followers are \nconsidered to be macro influencers or above (over one \nmillion followers is considered to be a mega influencer) \n[40]. Social media users tend to trust the influencers and \nbrands that they follow, [41] and the purpose of this study \nwas to capture information posted by popular Austral-\nian Instagram accounts, therefore, only accounts with \ngreater than 100,000 followers were considered eligible \nfor inclusion. Accounts appearing under the \u201csuggested\u201d \ntab on the Instagram page of included accounts were \nalso screened. Screening was done between May and July \n2021 using an Instagram account made specifically for \nthe project and using Google Chrome\u2019s incognito mode \nto minimise the impact of the algorithm on the sug-\ngested accounts. Two researchers (ED and JV, named in \nacknowledgements) independently screened all accounts \nand disagreements were discussed until agreement was \nreached.\nAll posts by eligible accounts from a twelve-month \nperiod (September 2020 \u2013 September 2021) were down-\nloaded through a paid subscription to Keyhole, an online \nsocial media analytics tool. The data extracted through \nKeyhole included each post\u2019s text-based caption, engage-\nment (sum of likes and comments), the date of upload \nand each account\u2019s bio, number of followers and if it \nwas verified with a blue tick. Each post was manually \nscreened for relevance. Video content including Reels \nand posts that did not refer to one or more component \nof nutrition-related information, as defined in Table\u00a0 1, \nwere excluded. Ten percent of posts were screened inde-\npendently by the lead author (ED) and a research assis-\ntant (JV) for relevance to nutrition information, with 94% \n"

Int J Behav Nutr Phys Act           (2024) 21:16 \nIntroduction\nPoor diet quality is the leading preventable risk factor \ncontributing to the global burden of non-communica-\nble disease [1]. Dietary behaviours are complex and are \ninfluenced by a range of factors, including hunger, taste \npreferences, food availability, price, societal norms, and \npolicy context [2]. Nutrition information environments, \nwhich encompass the media and advertising, can also \nexert an influence on dietary behaviours [2]. Social media \nhas recently become a prominent part of the modern \nmedia environment and is a popular vehicle for advertis-\ning, marketing and information sharing. Fifty-nine per-\ncent of the global population are active on social media, \n[3] and social media advertising revenue was projected to \nreach $173 billion USD in 2022 [4]. Food and nutrition \nare popular topics on social media platforms, [5, 6] and \nmarketing of food and supplement products has become \nprolific [7, 8]. There is a growing body of evidence that \nindicates food and nutrition content and marketing \non social media has the power to influence food choice \n[9\u201312].\nAs the Internet has become more accessible, individu-\nals have increasingly utilised it to source information \nabout nutrition. Consumers seek nutrition information \nfor various reasons including health management, curi-\nosity, and interest\u00a0 [13]. Nutrition information is con-\ntent that provides the general public with guidance on \nsourcing, storing, preparing and consuming food to sup-\nport good health, and includes recipes, product details, \nhealthy-eating advice and nutritional requirements \n(defined in full in Table\u00a01). Increases in online nutrition \ninformation seeking behaviour have been observed in \nAmerica, [14] Canada, [15] France, [16] and Norway, [17] \nand the Internet is the primary source of nutrition infor-\nmation for Australians [18, 19]. Social media has become \na ubiquitous part of the Internet and consumers search \nfor and follow food and nutrition-related content on \nsocial media [6, 20\u201322]. A survey of American Instagram \nusers found that 87% of female users followed nutrition-\nrelated content on the platform [6]. Consumers not only \nseek information about food and nutrition on social \nmedia they are also passively exposed to it in their social \nmedia feeds without intentionally searching for it [23, \n24]. Due to the influence of social media algorithms and \npaid sponsorships, social media users are also presented \nwith content in their feed from entities that they do not \nfollow. Furthermore, content can be published by anyone, \nregardless of their qualifications, level of expertise in the \ntopic or conflicting interests.\nAccurate and high-quality information is essential \nfor effective health communication and promotion. In \nhealth communication literature, accuracy refers to \nhealth information\u2019s factual correctness, and quality \nrefers to information\u2019s reliability when assessed using \ndefined quality criteria (see Table\u00a0 1) [25, 26]. Quality \nand accuracy are two important but distinct compo-\nnents of information\u2019s overall reliability. It is possible \nfor information to be accurate but of low quality and \nvice versa. Previous studies have assessed the accu-\nracy of online nutrition information against authorita-\ntive sources such as dietary guidelines, authoritative \nreports and peer reviewed literature [25]. Numerous \nquality assessment tools have been used to evaluate \nthe quality of online nutrition information, such as the \nDISCERN Instrument, [27]. Journal of the American \nMedical Association Benchmarks, [28] and Health on \nthe Net Code Principles [7, 29]. These tools share com-\nmon quality criteria, such as, declaring financial inter-\nests, citing sources, authorship by an individual with \nrelevant health-related qualifications, and disclosure of \nthe author\u2019s qualifications. Principles for Health-related \nInformation on Social Media (PRHISM), is a recently \ndeveloped quality assessment tool, which includes \nthese established quality principles and additional \nprinciples that are relevant to social media, including \naccessibility and readability [30]. There is a broad con-\nsensus in the literature that health information of sub-\noptimal quality and accuracy is extremely prevalent on \nsocial media [26, 31]. Concerningly, misinformation is \noften more popular than truthful information, receives \nhigher user engagement and spreads more quickly than \nthe truth due to its novelty [31, 32].

Social media-based misinformation can \nhave consequences for public health, for example, the \nonline anti-vaccination movement is believed to have \ncontributed to a reduction in vaccination rates and the \nreemergence of previously eradicated communicable \ndiseases [31, 33].\nPublic health nutrition experts and organisations have \nraised concerns about the potential for nutrition-related \nmisinformation to cause serious harm and undermine \ncredible nutrition communication.

If dietary behav-\niours are based on misinformation that contradicts evi-\ndence-based dietary guidelines, it may put individuals at \ngreater risk of developing non-communicable diseases \nthat are associated with unhealthy dietary patterns [1]. A \nrecent systematic review of studies evaluating the quality \nand accuracy of nutrition-related information published \non websites and social media found that generally infor-\nmation was of suboptimal quality and accuracy [25].

Therefore, the aim of this study was to evalu-\nate the quality and accuracy of nutrition information \nposted by popular Australian Instagram accounts using \nthe PRHISM tool to assess quality.

Briefly, a list of the top 1,000 Australian \nhealth Instagram accounts as of April 2021 was screened \nto determine eligibility [39]. Australian accounts with \nover 100,000 followers, a minimum of 100 posts, their \nmost recent post published within two weeks, and a \nminimum of 25% of their content relating to nutrition \nwere included.

The screening resulted in a sample of 10,964 \nInstagram posts containing nutrition-related informa-\ntion, which have been characterised in a previous content \nanalysis study [7].\nFor this study, a random stratified (by Instagram \naccount) subsample of the 10,964 posts were selected and \nscreened further for eligibility. A total of 2,025 posts were \nrandomly selected to be screened (up to 35 posts from \neach of the included Instagram accounts). The random \nsubsample for screening was selected using the sample \nfunction in Stata in March 2022. Posts that promoted a \nproduct but did not include any information about the \nhealth benefits of the product, for example, promotion of \na supplement without mention of its benefits, and posts \nthat only included recipes or meal ideas and no additional \ninformation were excluded because these posts did not \nprovide nutrition guidance that could be evaluated for \naccuracy or quality. All other posts were deemed eligible. \nScreening was done independently by two researchers \n(all posts screened by ED and with secondary screening \nby SM, LM or research assistant JL). Disagreements were \ndiscussed by the two researchers responsible for screen-\ning the relevant post until consensus was reached.\nQuality and\u00a0accuracy evaluations\nThe quality of information was evaluated using the \nPRHISM tool [30]. PRHISM was developed as a tool to \nevaluate the quality of social media-based information \nabout any health-related topic and considers the unique \ncharacteristics of social media content, for example, \ncovert advertising and brevity of information. To the \nknowledge of the authors, PRHISM is the only qual-\nity assessment tool that has been specifically developed \nfor health information delivered via social media. Other \ntools for evaluating the quality of health-related informa-\ntion exist. However, these tools were developed for dif-\nferent settings, such as websites or patient information \npamphlets and their use to evaluate health-related social \nmedia content has been scrutinised in the literature [25, \n42, 43]. PRHISM was developed in a Delphi study, which \ninvolved a panel of 18 expert participants [30]. The par-\nticipants were experts in health communication or a \nhealth-related field, used social media to communicate \nabout health and worked in academia, public health, \ncommunications and/or as health professionals. Three \nDelphi surveys were undertaken to determine group con-\nsensus about the principles to include in PRHISM. Prin-\nciples were based on quality criteria from previous tools \nand adapted to suit social media or were new principles \nsuggested by the expert panel. After the third Delphi sur-\nvey, a draft of the PRHISM scoring tool and guide for use \nwas circulated to participants for feedback about face \nvalidity and participants agreed with the final wording of \nthe principles and guide [30].\nPRHISM consists of thirteen principles that are scored \nfrom zero to four [30].

Int J Behav Nutr Phys Act           (2024) 21:16 \nIntroduction\nPoor diet quality is the leading preventable risk factor \ncontributing to the global burden of non-communica-\nble disease [1]. Dietary behaviours are complex and are \ninfluenced by a range of factors, including hunger, taste \npreferences, food availability, price, societal norms, and \npolicy context [2]. Nutrition information environments, \nwhich encompass the media and advertising, can also \nexert an influence on dietary behaviours [2]. Social media \nhas recently become a prominent part of the modern \nmedia environment and is a popular vehicle for advertis-\ning, marketing and information sharing. Fifty-nine per-\ncent of the global population are active on social media, \n[3] and social media advertising revenue was projected to \nreach $173 billion USD in 2022 [4]. Food and nutrition \nare popular topics on social media platforms, [5, 6] and \nmarketing of food and supplement products has become \nprolific [7, 8]. There is a growing body of evidence that \nindicates food and nutrition content and marketing \non social media has the power to influence food choice \n[9\u201312].\nAs the Internet has become more accessible, individu-\nals have increasingly utilised it to source information \nabout nutrition. Consumers seek nutrition information \nfor various reasons including health management, curi-\nosity, and interest\u00a0 [13]. Nutrition information is con-\ntent that provides the general public with guidance on \nsourcing, storing, preparing and consuming food to sup-\nport good health, and includes recipes, product details, \nhealthy-eating advice and nutritional requirements \n(defined in full in Table\u00a01). Increases in online nutrition \ninformation seeking behaviour have been observed in \nAmerica, [14] Canada, [15] France, [16] and Norway, [17] \nand the Internet is the primary source of nutrition infor-\nmation for Australians [18, 19]. Social media has become \na ubiquitous part of the Internet and consumers search \nfor and follow food and nutrition-related content on \nsocial media [6, 20\u201322]. A survey of American Instagram \nusers found that 87% of female users followed nutrition-\nrelated content on the platform [6]. Consumers not only \nseek information about food and nutrition on social \nmedia they are also passively exposed to it in their social \nmedia feeds without intentionally searching for it [23, \n24]. Due to the influence of social media algorithms and \npaid sponsorships, social media users are also presented \nwith content in their feed from entities that they do not \nfollow. Furthermore, content can be published by anyone, \nregardless of their qualifications, level of expertise in the \ntopic or conflicting interests.\nAccurate and high-quality information is essential \nfor effective health communication and promotion. In \nhealth communication literature, accuracy refers to \nhealth information\u2019s factual correctness, and quality \nrefers to information\u2019s reliability when assessed using \ndefined quality criteria (see Table\u00a0 1) [25, 26]. Quality \nand accuracy are two important but distinct compo-\nnents of information\u2019s overall reliability. It is possible \nfor information to be accurate but of low quality and \nvice versa. Previous studies have assessed the accu-\nracy of online nutrition information against authorita-\ntive sources such as dietary guidelines, authoritative \nreports and peer reviewed literature [25]. Numerous \nquality assessment tools have been used to evaluate \nthe quality of online nutrition information, such as the \nDISCERN Instrument, [27]. Journal of the American \nMedical Association Benchmarks, [28] and Health on \nthe Net Code Principles [7, 29]. These tools share com-\nmon quality criteria, such as, declaring financial inter-\nests, citing sources, authorship by an individual with \nrelevant health-related qualifications, and disclosure of \nthe author\u2019s qualifications. Principles for Health-related \nInformation on Social Media (PRHISM), is a recently \ndeveloped quality assessment tool, which includes \nthese established quality principles and additional \nprinciples that are relevant to social media, including \naccessibility and readability [30]. There is a broad con-\nsensus in the literature that health information of sub-\noptimal quality and accuracy is extremely prevalent on \nsocial media [26, 31]. Concerningly, misinformation is \noften more popular than truthful information, receives \nhigher user engagement and spreads more quickly than \nthe truth due to its novelty [31, 32]. Furthermore, the \nnarrative of health misinformation often includes and \npromotes mistrust in authoritative institutions and \nTable\u202f1\u2002 Key definitions\na From Denniss et\u00a0al. [25]\nAccuracy: The factual correctness of\u00a0information when\u00a0compared to\u00a0authoritative sources of\u00a0information such as\u00a0systematic reviews, meta analyses \nor\u00a0national dietary guidelines [25].\nQuality: The reliability of\u00a0information as\u00a0assessed by\u00a0quality criteria [26]. Quality criteria typically include components such as\u00a0readability, inclusion of\u00a0ref-\nerences, transparency about\u00a0financial interests and\u00a0disclosure of\u00a0the\u00a0author\u2019s identity and\u00a0qualifications\naNutrition-related information: information regarding\u00a0healthy eating, dietary patterns, nutrients, nutritional requirements, nutritional composition \nof\u00a0foods, nutritional supplements, health outcomes associated with\u00a0foods and\u00a0dietary patterns, food safety, food ethics, cooking and\u00a0recipes intended \nfor\u00a0the\u00a0general public [25].\nPage 3 of 14\nDenniss\u00a0et\u00a0al. Int J Behav Nutr Phys Act           (2024) 21:16 \n\t\nexperts [31]. Social media-based misinformation can \nhave consequences for public health, for example, the \nonline anti-vaccination movement is believed to have \ncontributed to a reduction in vaccination rates and the \nreemergence of previously eradicated communicable \ndiseases [31, 33].\nPublic health nutrition experts and organisations have \nraised concerns about the potential for nutrition-related \nmisinformation to cause serious harm and undermine \ncredible nutrition communication. Exposure to nutri-\ntion information that lacks context or contradicts previ-\nous messaging can lead to confusion and backlash, which \nhas been evidenced to reduce consumers\u2019 willingness \nto engage in healthful behaviours and accept advice by \nauthoritative nutrition experts [34, 35]. If dietary behav-\niours are based on misinformation that contradicts evi-\ndence-based dietary guidelines, it may put individuals at \ngreater risk of developing non-communicable diseases \nthat are associated with unhealthy dietary patterns [1]. A \nrecent systematic review of studies evaluating the quality \nand accuracy of nutrition-related information published \non websites and social media found that generally infor-\nmation was of suboptimal quality and accuracy [25]. A \nsmall number of studies in the review investigated cer-\ntain social media (e.g., blogs, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter \nand WhatsApp), meaning other platforms, such as Insta-\ngram have had limited attention [25]. A further limitation \nwas that quality assessment tools designed for different \nsettings, for example, websites, were used to evaluate the \nsocial media content [25]. Furthermore, it was also rare \nfor studies to involve multiple researchers when screen-\ning posts to evaluate, which is a potential source of bias \n[25]. One recent study that was not captured within the \ndate-range of the systematic review examined the qual-\nity of nutrition-related information on Instagram find-\ning that quality was extremely low [36]. However, this \nstudy measured quality as a single criterion, rather than \nusing an extensive quality assessment method, and thus \nmay not have comprehensively measured the quality of \ninformation.\nTo the knowledge of the authors, thus far no studies \nhave assessed the accuracy of nutrition information on \nInstagram, and none have used social media specific tools \nto evaluate the quality of nutrition-related Instagram \ncontent. Instagram was the third most popular social \nmedia platform in Australia, and the fifth most visited \nwebsite in the world in 2021, [3,\u00a037] and nutrition is one \nof the most frequently discussed health topics on Insta-\ngram [5]. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evalu-\nate the quality and accuracy of nutrition information \nposted by popular Australian Instagram accounts using \nthe PRHISM tool to assess quality. A secondary aim was \nto examine trends in information quality and accuracy by \nauthor, topic, post engagement, account verification and \nnumber of followers.\nMethods\nStudy design and\u00a0data collection\nThe present study involved a cross-sectional evaluation \nof the quality and accuracy of nutrition-related infor-\nmation published on Instagram by Australian influencer \nor brand accounts. The Strengthening the Reporting of \nObservational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guide-\nlines were followed and the checklist is available in Sup-\nplementary Table\u00a01 [38]. A subsample of Instagram posts \ncollected for a wider project formed the dataset for this \nstudy and data collection has been described in detail \nelsewhere [7]. Briefly, a list of the top 1,000 Australian \nhealth Instagram accounts as of April 2021 was screened \nto determine eligibility [39]. Australian accounts with \nover 100,000 followers, a minimum of 100 posts, their \nmost recent post published within two weeks, and a \nminimum of 25% of their content relating to nutrition \nwere included. The figure of 100,000 followers was cho-\nsen because accounts with over 100,000 followers are \nconsidered to be macro influencers or above (over one \nmillion followers is considered to be a mega influencer) \n[40]. Social media users tend to trust the influencers and \nbrands that they follow, [41] and the purpose of this study \nwas to capture information posted by popular Austral-\nian Instagram accounts, therefore, only accounts with \ngreater than 100,000 followers were considered eligible \nfor inclusion. Accounts appearing under the \u201csuggested\u201d \ntab on the Instagram page of included accounts were \nalso screened. Screening was done between May and July \n2021 using an Instagram account made specifically for \nthe project and using Google Chrome\u2019s incognito mode \nto minimise the impact of the algorithm on the sug-\ngested accounts. Two researchers (ED and JV, named in \nacknowledgements) independently screened all accounts \nand disagreements were discussed until agreement was \nreached.\nAll posts by eligible accounts from a twelve-month \nperiod (September 2020 \u2013 September 2021) were down-\nloaded through a paid subscription to Keyhole, an online \nsocial media analytics tool. The data extracted through \nKeyhole included each post\u2019s text-based caption, engage-\nment (sum of likes and comments), the date of upload \nand each account\u2019s bio, number of followers and if it \nwas verified with a blue tick. Each post was manually \nscreened for relevance. Video content including Reels \nand posts that did not refer to one or more component \nof nutrition-related information, as defined in Table\u00a0 1, \nwere excluded. Ten percent of posts were screened inde-\npendently by the lead author (ED) and a research assis-\ntant (JV) for relevance to nutrition information, with 94% \nPage 4 of 14\nDenniss\u00a0et\u00a0al. Int J Behav Nutr Phys Act           (2024) 21:16 \nagreement. The screening resulted in a sample of 10,964 \nInstagram posts containing nutrition-related informa-\ntion, which have been characterised in a previous content \nanalysis study [7].\nFor this study, a random stratified (by Instagram \naccount) subsample of the 10,964 posts were selected and \nscreened further for eligibility. A total of 2,025 posts were \nrandomly selected to be screened (up to 35 posts from \neach of the included Instagram accounts). The random \nsubsample for screening was selected using the sample \nfunction in Stata in March 2022. Posts that promoted a \nproduct but did not include any information about the \nhealth benefits of the product, for example, promotion of \na supplement without mention of its benefits, and posts \nthat only included recipes or meal ideas and no additional \ninformation were excluded because these posts did not \nprovide nutrition guidance that could be evaluated for \naccuracy or quality. All other posts were deemed eligible. \nScreening was done independently by two researchers \n(all posts screened by ED and with secondary screening \nby SM, LM or research assistant JL). Disagreements were \ndiscussed by the two researchers responsible for screen-\ning the relevant post until consensus was reached.\nQuality and\u00a0accuracy evaluations\nThe quality of information was evaluated using the \nPRHISM tool [30]. PRHISM was developed as a tool to \nevaluate the quality of social media-based information \nabout any health-related topic and considers the unique \ncharacteristics of social media content, for example, \ncovert advertising and brevity of information. To the \nknowledge of the authors, PRHISM is the only qual-\nity assessment tool that has been specifically developed \nfor health information delivered via social media. Other \ntools for evaluating the quality of health-related informa-\ntion exist. However, these tools were developed for dif-\nferent settings, such as websites or patient information \npamphlets and their use to evaluate health-related social \nmedia content has been scrutinised in the literature [25, \n42, 43]. PRHISM was developed in a Delphi study, which \ninvolved a panel of 18 expert participants [30]. The par-\nticipants were experts in health communication or a \nhealth-related field, used social media to communicate \nabout health and worked in academia, public health, \ncommunications and/or as health professionals. Three \nDelphi surveys were undertaken to determine group con-\nsensus about the principles to include in PRHISM. Prin-\nciples were based on quality criteria from previous tools \nand adapted to suit social media or were new principles \nsuggested by the expert panel. After the third Delphi sur-\nvey, a draft of the PRHISM scoring tool and guide for use \nwas circulated to participants for feedback about face \nvalidity and participants agreed with the final wording of \nthe principles and guide [30].\nPRHISM consists of thirteen principles that are scored \nfrom zero to four [30]. A number of principles may not \nbe relevant to evaluate depending on the nature of the \nsocial media post being evaluated, for example, principle \n8 relates to privacy and is only relevant to evaluate if the \npost discusses a client or patient. The overall PRHISM \nscore is weighted proportionately as a percentage of the \ntotal available score, whereby principles that are deemed \nnot relevant do not contribute to the total available score. \nThe overall PRHISM score ranges from 0 \u2013 100 where a \nhigher score indicates higher quality. A score of zero to \n25 is considered poor, 26\u2013 50 mediocre, 51 \u2013 75 good \nand 76 \u2013 100 excellent quality [30]. All images and infor-\nmation contained within the post, information in the \naccount holder\u2019s bio and information contained in links \nprovided within the post or bio were considered in qual-\nity evaluations, as outlined in the PRHISM protocol [30]. \nA summary of the PRHISM assessment principles is \nincluded in Table\u00a02.\nTo determine accuracy, the information contained in \nthe Instagram posts was evaluated against information \ncontained in the Australian Dietary Guidelines (ADG) \n[44] Nutrient Reference Values (NRVs), Practice-based \nEvidence in Nutrition Global Resource for Nutrition \nPractice (PEN), [45] and/or Metafact fact-checking plat-\nform. [46] Metafact is a website that enables the public \nto ask questions, which are answered by verified PhDs, \nresearchers and medical specialists.[46] Multiple experts \ncan answer the questions and if\u2009\u2265\u200970% of verified experts \nagree on an answer, it is deemed that consensus has \nbeen achieved [46]. Only questions with consensus were \nused for accuracy evaluations. A large number of posts \nwithin the sample contained claims about the benefits of \ncollagen supplementation for skin health, however, rel-\nevant information was not contained within the chosen \nauthoritative resources. Therefore, a recent systematic \nreview about collagen supplementation was also used to \ndetermine the accuracy of claims about collagen and skin \nhealth [47]. An accuracy coding framework was devel-\noped and was informed by a systematic review of the \nquality and accuracy of online nutrition information [25]. \nPosts were coded as containing information that is com-\npletely inaccurate (0), mostly inaccurate with some accu-\nracies (1), mostly accurate with some inaccuracies (2), \ncompletely accurate (3) or not assessable (4) (see Table\u20092 \nfor descriptions of accuracy categories). All the nutrition \ninformation within a post was considered when evaluat-\ning accuracy. If posts contained information about nutri-\ntion and other topics, such as sleep or exercise, only the \ninformation about nutrition was evaluated. Some posts \ncontained claims about the health benefits of specific \nPage 5 of 14\nDenniss\u00a0et\u00a0al.

In \nthese instances, additional information about the prod-\nuct was sourced from its website in order to evaluate the \naccuracy of the claims.\nAssessments were conducted and recorded in a pur-\npose-designed REDCap database. A set of coding rules \nwas developed to ensure that information that appeared \nmultiple times in the sample of posts was coded consist-\nently for accuracy. Before completing the quality and \naccuracy evaluations, a random 10% if the sample was \nevaluated independently by two authors (ED and LM) for \ninter-rater reliability, achieving 79% agreement for quality \ncategory and 85% for accuracy score. Disagreements \nregarding quality or accuracy evaluations were discussed \nby ED and LM until consensus was reached. Common \nreasons for disagreement were discussed and relevant \nupdates to the study protocol were made before the \nremaining evaluations were completed to improve rigor. \nED conducted the quality and accuracy assessments for \nthe remainder of the sample to further improve consist-\nency. Posts containing information that was difficult to \nevaluate were discussed before reaching a decision. Ins-\ntagram accounts and the topic of Instagram posts were \ninductively categorised. The categories for Instagram \naccounts were developed by the two researchers (ED and \nJV) who undertook the screening of Instagram accounts, \nTable\u202f2\u2002 Summary of quality principles assessed by the PRHISM tool and accuracy score categories\nAbbreviations: PRHISM: Principles for Health-related Information on Social Media\na From: Denniss et\u00a0al.

Int J Behav Nutr Phys Act           (2024) 21:16 \nIntroduction\nPoor diet quality is the leading preventable risk factor \ncontributing to the global burden of non-communica-\nble disease [1]. Dietary behaviours are complex and are \ninfluenced by a range of factors, including hunger, taste \npreferences, food availability, price, societal norms, and \npolicy context [2]. Nutrition information environments, \nwhich encompass the media and advertising, can also \nexert an influence on dietary behaviours [2]. Social media \nhas recently become a prominent part of the modern \nmedia environment and is a popular vehicle for advertis-\ning, marketing and information sharing. Fifty-nine per-\ncent of the global population are active on social media, \n[3] and social media advertising revenue was projected to \nreach $173 billion USD in 2022 [4]. Food and nutrition \nare popular topics on social media platforms, [5, 6] and \nmarketing of food and supplement products has become \nprolific [7, 8]. There is a growing body of evidence that \nindicates food and nutrition content and marketing \non social media has the power to influence food choice \n[9\u201312].\nAs the Internet has become more accessible, individu-\nals have increasingly utilised it to source information \nabout nutrition. Consumers seek nutrition information \nfor various reasons including health management, curi-\nosity, and interest\u00a0 [13]. Nutrition information is con-\ntent that provides the general public with guidance on \nsourcing, storing, preparing and consuming food to sup-\nport good health, and includes recipes, product details, \nhealthy-eating advice and nutritional requirements \n(defined in full in Table\u00a01). Increases in online nutrition \ninformation seeking behaviour have been observed in \nAmerica, [14] Canada, [15] France, [16] and Norway, [17] \nand the Internet is the primary source of nutrition infor-\nmation for Australians [18, 19]. Social media has become \na ubiquitous part of the Internet and consumers search \nfor and follow food and nutrition-related content on \nsocial media [6, 20\u201322]. A survey of American Instagram \nusers found that 87% of female users followed nutrition-\nrelated content on the platform [6]. Consumers not only \nseek information about food and nutrition on social \nmedia they are also passively exposed to it in their social \nmedia feeds without intentionally searching for it [23, \n24]. Due to the influence of social media algorithms and \npaid sponsorships, social media users are also presented \nwith content in their feed from entities that they do not \nfollow. Furthermore, content can be published by anyone, \nregardless of their qualifications, level of expertise in the \ntopic or conflicting interests.\nAccurate and high-quality information is essential \nfor effective health communication and promotion. In \nhealth communication literature, accuracy refers to \nhealth information\u2019s factual correctness, and quality \nrefers to information\u2019s reliability when assessed using \ndefined quality criteria (see Table\u00a0 1) [25, 26]. Quality \nand accuracy are two important but distinct compo-\nnents of information\u2019s overall reliability. It is possible \nfor information to be accurate but of low quality and \nvice versa. Previous studies have assessed the accu-\nracy of online nutrition information against authorita-\ntive sources such as dietary guidelines, authoritative \nreports and peer reviewed literature [25]. Numerous \nquality assessment tools have been used to evaluate \nthe quality of online nutrition information, such as the \nDISCERN Instrument, [27]. Journal of the American \nMedical Association Benchmarks, [28] and Health on \nthe Net Code Principles [7, 29]. These tools share com-\nmon quality criteria, such as, declaring financial inter-\nests, citing sources, authorship by an individual with \nrelevant health-related qualifications, and disclosure of \nthe author\u2019s qualifications. Principles for Health-related \nInformation on Social Media (PRHISM), is a recently \ndeveloped quality assessment tool, which includes \nthese established quality principles and additional \nprinciples that are relevant to social media, including \naccessibility and readability [30]. There is a broad con-\nsensus in the literature that health information of sub-\noptimal quality and accuracy is extremely prevalent on \nsocial media [26, 31]. Concerningly, misinformation is \noften more popular than truthful information, receives \nhigher user engagement and spreads more quickly than \nthe truth due to its novelty [31, 32]. Furthermore, the \nnarrative of health misinformation often includes and \npromotes mistrust in authoritative institutions and \nTable\u202f1\u2002 Key definitions\na From Denniss et\u00a0al. [25]\nAccuracy: The factual correctness of\u00a0information when\u00a0compared to\u00a0authoritative sources of\u00a0information such as\u00a0systematic reviews, meta analyses \nor\u00a0national dietary guidelines [25].\nQuality: The reliability of\u00a0information as\u00a0assessed by\u00a0quality criteria [26]. Quality criteria typically include components such as\u00a0readability, inclusion of\u00a0ref-\nerences, transparency about\u00a0financial interests and\u00a0disclosure of\u00a0the\u00a0author\u2019s identity and\u00a0qualifications\naNutrition-related information: information regarding\u00a0healthy eating, dietary patterns, nutrients, nutritional requirements, nutritional composition \nof\u00a0foods, nutritional supplements, health outcomes associated with\u00a0foods and\u00a0dietary patterns, food safety, food ethics, cooking and\u00a0recipes intended \nfor\u00a0the\u00a0general public [25].\nPage 3 of 14\nDenniss\u00a0et\u00a0al. Int J Behav Nutr Phys Act           (2024) 21:16 \n\t\nexperts [31]. Social media-based misinformation can \nhave consequences for public health, for example, the \nonline anti-vaccination movement is believed to have \ncontributed to a reduction in vaccination rates and the \nreemergence of previously eradicated communicable \ndiseases [31, 33].\nPublic health nutrition experts and organisations have \nraised concerns about the potential for nutrition-related \nmisinformation to cause serious harm and undermine \ncredible nutrition communication. Exposure to nutri-\ntion information that lacks context or contradicts previ-\nous messaging can lead to confusion and backlash, which \nhas been evidenced to reduce consumers\u2019 willingness \nto engage in healthful behaviours and accept advice by \nauthoritative nutrition experts [34, 35]. If dietary behav-\niours are based on misinformation that contradicts evi-\ndence-based dietary guidelines, it may put individuals at \ngreater risk of developing non-communicable diseases \nthat are associated with unhealthy dietary patterns [1]. A \nrecent systematic review of studies evaluating the quality \nand accuracy of nutrition-related information published \non websites and social media found that generally infor-\nmation was of suboptimal quality and accuracy [25]. A \nsmall number of studies in the review investigated cer-\ntain social media (e.g., blogs, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter \nand WhatsApp), meaning other platforms, such as Insta-\ngram have had limited attention [25]. A further limitation \nwas that quality assessment tools designed for different \nsettings, for example, websites, were used to evaluate the \nsocial media content [25]. Furthermore, it was also rare \nfor studies to involve multiple researchers when screen-\ning posts to evaluate, which is a potential source of bias \n[25]. One recent study that was not captured within the \ndate-range of the systematic review examined the qual-\nity of nutrition-related information on Instagram find-\ning that quality was extremely low [36]. However, this \nstudy measured quality as a single criterion, rather than \nusing an extensive quality assessment method, and thus \nmay not have comprehensively measured the quality of \ninformation.\nTo the knowledge of the authors, thus far no studies \nhave assessed the accuracy of nutrition information on \nInstagram, and none have used social media specific tools \nto evaluate the quality of nutrition-related Instagram \ncontent. Instagram was the third most popular social \nmedia platform in Australia, and the fifth most visited \nwebsite in the world in 2021, [3,\u00a037] and nutrition is one \nof the most frequently discussed health topics on Insta-\ngram [5]. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evalu-\nate the quality and accuracy of nutrition information \nposted by popular Australian Instagram accounts using \nthe PRHISM tool to assess quality. A secondary aim was \nto examine trends in information quality and accuracy by \nauthor, topic, post engagement, account verification and \nnumber of followers.\nMethods\nStudy design and\u00a0data collection\nThe present study involved a cross-sectional evaluation \nof the quality and accuracy of nutrition-related infor-\nmation published on Instagram by Australian influencer \nor brand accounts. The Strengthening the Reporting of \nObservational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guide-\nlines were followed and the checklist is available in Sup-\nplementary Table\u00a01 [38]. A subsample of Instagram posts \ncollected for a wider project formed the dataset for this \nstudy and data collection has been described in detail \nelsewhere [7]. Briefly, a list of the top 1,000 Australian \nhealth Instagram accounts as of April 2021 was screened \nto determine eligibility [39]. Australian accounts with \nover 100,000 followers, a minimum of 100 posts, their \nmost recent post published within two weeks, and a \nminimum of 25% of their content relating to nutrition \nwere included. The figure of 100,000 followers was cho-\nsen because accounts with over 100,000 followers are \nconsidered to be macro influencers or above (over one \nmillion followers is considered to be a mega influencer) \n[40]. Social media users tend to trust the influencers and \nbrands that they follow, [41] and the purpose of this study \nwas to capture information posted by popular Austral-\nian Instagram accounts, therefore, only accounts with \ngreater than 100,000 followers were considered eligible \nfor inclusion. Accounts appearing under the \u201csuggested\u201d \ntab on the Instagram page of included accounts were \nalso screened. Screening was done between May and July \n2021 using an Instagram account made specifically for \nthe project and using Google Chrome\u2019s incognito mode \nto minimise the impact of the algorithm on the sug-\ngested accounts. Two researchers (ED and JV, named in \nacknowledgements) independently screened all accounts \nand disagreements were discussed until agreement was \nreached.\nAll posts by eligible accounts from a twelve-month \nperiod (September 2020 \u2013 September 2021) were down-\nloaded through a paid subscription to Keyhole, an online \nsocial media analytics tool. The data extracted through \nKeyhole included each post\u2019s text-based caption, engage-\nment (sum of likes and comments), the date of upload \nand each account\u2019s bio, number of followers and if it \nwas verified with a blue tick. Each post was manually \nscreened for relevance. Video content including Reels \nand posts that did not refer to one or more component \nof nutrition-related information, as defined in Table\u00a0 1, \nwere excluded. Ten percent of posts were screened inde-\npendently by the lead author (ED) and a research assis-\ntant (JV) for relevance to nutrition information, with 94% \nPage 4 of 14\nDenniss\u00a0et\u00a0al. Int J Behav Nutr Phys Act           (2024) 21:16 \nagreement. The screening resulted in a sample of 10,964 \nInstagram posts containing nutrition-related informa-\ntion, which have been characterised in a previous content \nanalysis study [7].\nFor this study, a random stratified (by Instagram \naccount) subsample of the 10,964 posts were selected and \nscreened further for eligibility. A total of 2,025 posts were \nrandomly selected to be screened (up to 35 posts from \neach of the included Instagram accounts). The random \nsubsample for screening was selected using the sample \nfunction in Stata in March 2022. Posts that promoted a \nproduct but did not include any information about the \nhealth benefits of the product, for example, promotion of \na supplement without mention of its benefits, and posts \nthat only included recipes or meal ideas and no additional \ninformation were excluded because these posts did not \nprovide nutrition guidance that could be evaluated for \naccuracy or quality. All other posts were deemed eligible. \nScreening was done independently by two researchers \n(all posts screened by ED and with secondary screening \nby SM, LM or research assistant JL). Disagreements were \ndiscussed by the two researchers responsible for screen-\ning the relevant post until consensus was reached.\nQuality and\u00a0accuracy evaluations\nThe quality of information was evaluated using the \nPRHISM tool [30]. PRHISM was developed as a tool to \nevaluate the quality of social media-based information \nabout any health-related topic and considers the unique \ncharacteristics of social media content, for example, \ncovert advertising and brevity of information. To the \nknowledge of the authors, PRHISM is the only qual-\nity assessment tool that has been specifically developed \nfor health information delivered via social media. Other \ntools for evaluating the quality of health-related informa-\ntion exist. However, these tools were developed for dif-\nferent settings, such as websites or patient information \npamphlets and their use to evaluate health-related social \nmedia content has been scrutinised in the literature [25, \n42, 43]. PRHISM was developed in a Delphi study, which \ninvolved a panel of 18 expert participants [30]. The par-\nticipants were experts in health communication or a \nhealth-related field, used social media to communicate \nabout health and worked in academia, public health, \ncommunications and/or as health professionals. Three \nDelphi surveys were undertaken to determine group con-\nsensus about the principles to include in PRHISM. Prin-\nciples were based on quality criteria from previous tools \nand adapted to suit social media or were new principles \nsuggested by the expert panel. After the third Delphi sur-\nvey, a draft of the PRHISM scoring tool and guide for use \nwas circulated to participants for feedback about face \nvalidity and participants agreed with the final wording of \nthe principles and guide [30].\nPRHISM consists of thirteen principles that are scored \nfrom zero to four [30]. A number of principles may not \nbe relevant to evaluate depending on the nature of the \nsocial media post being evaluated, for example, principle \n8 relates to privacy and is only relevant to evaluate if the \npost discusses a client or patient. The overall PRHISM \nscore is weighted proportionately as a percentage of the \ntotal available score, whereby principles that are deemed \nnot relevant do not contribute to the total available score. \nThe overall PRHISM score ranges from 0 \u2013 100 where a \nhigher score indicates higher quality. A score of zero to \n25 is considered poor, 26\u2013 50 mediocre, 51 \u2013 75 good \nand 76 \u2013 100 excellent quality [30]. All images and infor-\nmation contained within the post, information in the \naccount holder\u2019s bio and information contained in links \nprovided within the post or bio were considered in qual-\nity evaluations, as outlined in the PRHISM protocol [30]. \nA summary of the PRHISM assessment principles is \nincluded in Table\u00a02.\nTo determine accuracy, the information contained in \nthe Instagram posts was evaluated against information \ncontained in the Australian Dietary Guidelines (ADG) \n[44] Nutrient Reference Values (NRVs), Practice-based \nEvidence in Nutrition Global Resource for Nutrition \nPractice (PEN), [45] and/or Metafact fact-checking plat-\nform. [46] Metafact is a website that enables the public \nto ask questions, which are answered by verified PhDs, \nresearchers and medical specialists.[46] Multiple experts \ncan answer the questions and if\u2009\u2265\u200970% of verified experts \nagree on an answer, it is deemed that consensus has \nbeen achieved [46]. Only questions with consensus were \nused for accuracy evaluations. A large number of posts \nwithin the sample contained claims about the benefits of \ncollagen supplementation for skin health, however, rel-\nevant information was not contained within the chosen \nauthoritative resources. Therefore, a recent systematic \nreview about collagen supplementation was also used to \ndetermine the accuracy of claims about collagen and skin \nhealth [47]. An accuracy coding framework was devel-\noped and was informed by a systematic review of the \nquality and accuracy of online nutrition information [25]. \nPosts were coded as containing information that is com-\npletely inaccurate (0), mostly inaccurate with some accu-\nracies (1), mostly accurate with some inaccuracies (2), \ncompletely accurate (3) or not assessable (4) (see Table\u20092 \nfor descriptions of accuracy categories). All the nutrition \ninformation within a post was considered when evaluat-\ning accuracy. If posts contained information about nutri-\ntion and other topics, such as sleep or exercise, only the \ninformation about nutrition was evaluated. Some posts \ncontained claims about the health benefits of specific \nPage 5 of 14\nDenniss\u00a0et\u00a0al. Int J Behav Nutr Phys Act           (2024) 21:16 \n\t\nproducts, such as supplements, but did not contain suffi-\ncient information about the nutrients or ingredients con-\ntained in the product for an assessment to be made. In \nthese instances, additional information about the prod-\nuct was sourced from its website in order to evaluate the \naccuracy of the claims.\nAssessments were conducted and recorded in a pur-\npose-designed REDCap database. A set of coding rules \nwas developed to ensure that information that appeared \nmultiple times in the sample of posts was coded consist-\nently for accuracy. Before completing the quality and \naccuracy evaluations, a random 10% if the sample was \nevaluated independently by two authors (ED and LM) for \ninter-rater reliability, achieving 79% agreement for quality \ncategory and 85% for accuracy score. Disagreements \nregarding quality or accuracy evaluations were discussed \nby ED and LM until consensus was reached. Common \nreasons for disagreement were discussed and relevant \nupdates to the study protocol were made before the \nremaining evaluations were completed to improve rigor. \nED conducted the quality and accuracy assessments for \nthe remainder of the sample to further improve consist-\nency. Posts containing information that was difficult to \nevaluate were discussed before reaching a decision. Ins-\ntagram accounts and the topic of Instagram posts were \ninductively categorised. The categories for Instagram \naccounts were developed by the two researchers (ED and \nJV) who undertook the screening of Instagram accounts, \nTable\u202f2\u2002 Summary of quality principles assessed by the PRHISM tool and accuracy score categories\nAbbreviations: PRHISM: Principles for Health-related Information on Social Media\na From: Denniss et\u00a0al.

Each included account was inde-\npendently categorised, and disagreements were discussed \nby ED and JV until agreement was reached. The catego-\nries for Instagram accounts were used in the preceding \nstudy for which the data was originally collected [7]. \nCategories for post topic were developed during the reli-\nability assessments based on the most frequent nutrition-\nrelated topics mentioned in the posts and all posts were \ncategorised by the first author. Descriptions of account \nand topic categories are summarised in Supplementary \nTable\u00a02.\nStatistical analysis\nData was exported from REDCap and statistical analyses \nwere performed in Stata/SE v17.0 (StataCorp, College \nStation, TX). Descriptive statistics were run. Multilevel \nmixed-effects models were used to estimate quality \nscores for account categories, post topics, account veri-\nfication, accuracy score, follower count, engagement, \nand engagement rate. Marginal means of quality scores \nfor account categories and post topics were calculated. \nPairwise comparisons were run to determine mean dif-\nferences in quality scores across account categories, post \ntopics and accuracy categories. Mixed-effects ordered \nlogistic regression models were used to estimate accu-\nracy score outcomes for account categories, post top-\nics, account verification, follower count, engagement \nand engagement rate. Pairwise comparisons were run \nto determine mean differences in quality scores across \naccount categories and post topics. Mixed-effects models \nwere chosen to account for the structure of the data, with \nthe possibility of repeat measures (i.e., multiple posts) \nfor each Instagram account, with posts being the unit \nof analysis and the models including random intercepts \nfor Instagram accounts. Quality and accuracy scores \nwere treated as the dependent variable. Engagement and \nengagement rate had positively skewed distributions and \nwere log transformed. One account had an outlying num-\nber of followers (>\u20092,000,000) and was thus removed from \nanalyses involving follower counts. After removing the \noutlying account, follower counts remained skewed and \nwere also log transformed to achieve normal distribution. \nAnalysis was run with and without the outlying account \nshowing little difference to the result (data not shown). \nStatistical significance was set at P\u2009<\u20090.05.\nEthics\nThe Instagram posts included in this study were pub-\nlicly available. Due to the public nature of the data, this \nstudy was exempt from formal review by an ethics com-\nmittee. To ensure that this study upholds ethical research \nstandards, no identifying information about the account-\nholders has been published.\nResults\nA total of 676 posts from 47 accounts were included in \nthe final sample (Fig.\u00a01, Table\u00a03). Accounts had an aver-\nage of 314,817 followers. The most common topic dis-\ncussed in posts was supplements (36.4%) followed by \nfoods/nutrients and health (17.2%), general healthy eat-\ning (16.0%), weight loss (13.5%), sports/exercise nutrition \n(6.7%), other (5.5%) and paediatric nutrition (4.9%).\nQuality\nOverall, 34.8% (n\u2009=\u2009235) of posts were classified as poor, \n59.2% (n\u2009=\u2009400) mediocre, 6.1% (n\u2009=\u200941) good and zero \nposts were classified as excellent quality. The mean \nPRHISM score was mediocre (31.8\u2009\u00b1\u200910.3 out of a pos-\nsible score of 100) and scores varied across principles \n(Table\u00a0 4). Only two principles had a mean score above \ntwo (4. Financial disclosure and 13. Images) (Table\u00a0 5). \nPosts authored by accounts in the nutritionist/dietitian \ninfluencer account category were associated with higher \nquality scores compared to the reference group (brands) \n(\u03b2, 17.8, CI 13.94\u201321.65; P\u2009<\u20090.001) and all other account \ncategories. Posts that contained information about foods/\nnutrients and health or general healthy eating were \nassociated with higher quality scores compared to the \nreference group (weight loss information) and posts con-\ntaining information about supplements. There was no \nassociation between information quality and accounts \nbeing verified (\u03b2 0.572, P\u2009=\u20090.821) or follower count (\u03b2 \n-1.18, P\u2009=\u20090.643). Lower quality scores were associated \nwith higher engagement (\u03b2 -0.59, P\u2009=\u20090.012) and higher \nengagement rate (\u03b2 -0.57, P\u2009=\u20090.016), although these dif-\nferences were small. A complete summary of the results \nfrom the mixed effects analysis of quality scores by \naccount type and post topic is provided in Supplemen-\ntary Table\u00a03 and 4.\nAccuracy\nFrom the 676 posts included in the sample, 166 were not \nassessable and a total of 510 posts were evaluated for \naccuracy (see Fig.\u00a0 1). Of the posts that were evaluated \nfor accuracy, 44.7% (n\u2009=\u2009228) of posts contained inac-\ncuracies, 8.6% (n\u2009=\u200944) of posts were completely inac-\ncurate, 14.3% (n\u2009=\u200973) mostly inaccurate, 21.8% (111) \nmostly accurate and 55.3% (n\u2009=\u2009282) completely accurate. \nPosts published by fitness influencers had higher odds of \nreceiving a higher score for accuracy compared to posts \npublished by brands (OR 3.09, CI 1.21\u20137.87, P\u2009=\u20090.018) \nas did posts published by nutritionist/dietitian influencer \naccounts (OR 4.69, CI 1.81\u201312.14, P\u2009=\u20090.001).

Int J Behav Nutr Phys Act           (2024) 21:16 \nIntroduction\nPoor diet quality is the leading preventable risk factor \ncontributing to the global burden of non-communica-\nble disease [1]. Dietary behaviours are complex and are \ninfluenced by a range of factors, including hunger, taste \npreferences, food availability, price, societal norms, and \npolicy context [2]. Nutrition information environments, \nwhich encompass the media and advertising, can also \nexert an influence on dietary behaviours [2]. Social media \nhas recently become a prominent part of the modern \nmedia environment and is a popular vehicle for advertis-\ning, marketing and information sharing. Fifty-nine per-\ncent of the global population are active on social media, \n[3] and social media advertising revenue was projected to \nreach $173 billion USD in 2022 [4]. Food and nutrition \nare popular topics on social media platforms, [5, 6] and \nmarketing of food and supplement products has become \nprolific [7, 8]. There is a growing body of evidence that \nindicates food and nutrition content and marketing \non social media has the power to influence food choice \n[9\u201312].\nAs the Internet has become more accessible, individu-\nals have increasingly utilised it to source information \nabout nutrition. Consumers seek nutrition information \nfor various reasons including health management, curi-\nosity, and interest\u00a0 [13]. Nutrition information is con-\ntent that provides the general public with guidance on \nsourcing, storing, preparing and consuming food to sup-\nport good health, and includes recipes, product details, \nhealthy-eating advice and nutritional requirements \n(defined in full in Table\u00a01). Increases in online nutrition \ninformation seeking behaviour have been observed in \nAmerica, [14] Canada, [15] France, [16] and Norway, [17] \nand the Internet is the primary source of nutrition infor-\nmation for Australians [18, 19]. Social media has become \na ubiquitous part of the Internet and consumers search \nfor and follow food and nutrition-related content on \nsocial media [6, 20\u201322]. A survey of American Instagram \nusers found that 87% of female users followed nutrition-\nrelated content on the platform [6]. Consumers not only \nseek information about food and nutrition on social \nmedia they are also passively exposed to it in their social \nmedia feeds without intentionally searching for it [23, \n24]. Due to the influence of social media algorithms and \npaid sponsorships, social media users are also presented \nwith content in their feed from entities that they do not \nfollow. Furthermore, content can be published by anyone, \nregardless of their qualifications, level of expertise in the \ntopic or conflicting interests.\nAccurate and high-quality information is essential \nfor effective health communication and promotion. In \nhealth communication literature, accuracy refers to \nhealth information\u2019s factual correctness, and quality \nrefers to information\u2019s reliability when assessed using \ndefined quality criteria (see Table\u00a0 1) [25, 26]. Quality \nand accuracy are two important but distinct compo-\nnents of information\u2019s overall reliability. It is possible \nfor information to be accurate but of low quality and \nvice versa. Previous studies have assessed the accu-\nracy of online nutrition information against authorita-\ntive sources such as dietary guidelines, authoritative \nreports and peer reviewed literature [25]. Numerous \nquality assessment tools have been used to evaluate \nthe quality of online nutrition information, such as the \nDISCERN Instrument, [27]. Journal of the American \nMedical Association Benchmarks, [28] and Health on \nthe Net Code Principles [7, 29]. These tools share com-\nmon quality criteria, such as, declaring financial inter-\nests, citing sources, authorship by an individual with \nrelevant health-related qualifications, and disclosure of \nthe author\u2019s qualifications. Principles for Health-related \nInformation on Social Media (PRHISM), is a recently \ndeveloped quality assessment tool, which includes \nthese established quality principles and additional \nprinciples that are relevant to social media, including \naccessibility and readability [30]. There is a broad con-\nsensus in the literature that health information of sub-\noptimal quality and accuracy is extremely prevalent on \nsocial media [26, 31]. Concerningly, misinformation is \noften more popular than truthful information, receives \nhigher user engagement and spreads more quickly than \nthe truth due to its novelty [31, 32]. Furthermore, the \nnarrative of health misinformation often includes and \npromotes mistrust in authoritative institutions and \nTable\u202f1\u2002 Key definitions\na From Denniss et\u00a0al. [25]\nAccuracy: The factual correctness of\u00a0information when\u00a0compared to\u00a0authoritative sources of\u00a0information such as\u00a0systematic reviews, meta analyses \nor\u00a0national dietary guidelines [25].\nQuality: The reliability of\u00a0information as\u00a0assessed by\u00a0quality criteria [26]. Quality criteria typically include components such as\u00a0readability, inclusion of\u00a0ref-\nerences, transparency about\u00a0financial interests and\u00a0disclosure of\u00a0the\u00a0author\u2019s identity and\u00a0qualifications\naNutrition-related information: information regarding\u00a0healthy eating, dietary patterns, nutrients, nutritional requirements, nutritional composition \nof\u00a0foods, nutritional supplements, health outcomes associated with\u00a0foods and\u00a0dietary patterns, food safety, food ethics, cooking and\u00a0recipes intended \nfor\u00a0the\u00a0general public [25].\nPage 3 of 14\nDenniss\u00a0et\u00a0al. Int J Behav Nutr Phys Act           (2024) 21:16 \n\t\nexperts [31]. Social media-based misinformation can \nhave consequences for public health, for example, the \nonline anti-vaccination movement is believed to have \ncontributed to a reduction in vaccination rates and the \nreemergence of previously eradicated communicable \ndiseases [31, 33].\nPublic health nutrition experts and organisations have \nraised concerns about the potential for nutrition-related \nmisinformation to cause serious harm and undermine \ncredible nutrition communication. Exposure to nutri-\ntion information that lacks context or contradicts previ-\nous messaging can lead to confusion and backlash, which \nhas been evidenced to reduce consumers\u2019 willingness \nto engage in healthful behaviours and accept advice by \nauthoritative nutrition experts [34, 35]. If dietary behav-\niours are based on misinformation that contradicts evi-\ndence-based dietary guidelines, it may put individuals at \ngreater risk of developing non-communicable diseases \nthat are associated with unhealthy dietary patterns [1]. A \nrecent systematic review of studies evaluating the quality \nand accuracy of nutrition-related information published \non websites and social media found that generally infor-\nmation was of suboptimal quality and accuracy [25]. A \nsmall number of studies in the review investigated cer-\ntain social media (e.g., blogs, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter \nand WhatsApp), meaning other platforms, such as Insta-\ngram have had limited attention [25]. A further limitation \nwas that quality assessment tools designed for different \nsettings, for example, websites, were used to evaluate the \nsocial media content [25]. Furthermore, it was also rare \nfor studies to involve multiple researchers when screen-\ning posts to evaluate, which is a potential source of bias \n[25]. One recent study that was not captured within the \ndate-range of the systematic review examined the qual-\nity of nutrition-related information on Instagram find-\ning that quality was extremely low [36]. However, this \nstudy measured quality as a single criterion, rather than \nusing an extensive quality assessment method, and thus \nmay not have comprehensively measured the quality of \ninformation.\nTo the knowledge of the authors, thus far no studies \nhave assessed the accuracy of nutrition information on \nInstagram, and none have used social media specific tools \nto evaluate the quality of nutrition-related Instagram \ncontent. Instagram was the third most popular social \nmedia platform in Australia, and the fifth most visited \nwebsite in the world in 2021, [3,\u00a037] and nutrition is one \nof the most frequently discussed health topics on Insta-\ngram [5]. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evalu-\nate the quality and accuracy of nutrition information \nposted by popular Australian Instagram accounts using \nthe PRHISM tool to assess quality. A secondary aim was \nto examine trends in information quality and accuracy by \nauthor, topic, post engagement, account verification and \nnumber of followers.\nMethods\nStudy design and\u00a0data collection\nThe present study involved a cross-sectional evaluation \nof the quality and accuracy of nutrition-related infor-\nmation published on Instagram by Australian influencer \nor brand accounts. The Strengthening the Reporting of \nObservational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guide-\nlines were followed and the checklist is available in Sup-\nplementary Table\u00a01 [38]. A subsample of Instagram posts \ncollected for a wider project formed the dataset for this \nstudy and data collection has been described in detail \nelsewhere [7]. Briefly, a list of the top 1,000 Australian \nhealth Instagram accounts as of April 2021 was screened \nto determine eligibility [39]. Australian accounts with \nover 100,000 followers, a minimum of 100 posts, their \nmost recent post published within two weeks, and a \nminimum of 25% of their content relating to nutrition \nwere included. The figure of 100,000 followers was cho-\nsen because accounts with over 100,000 followers are \nconsidered to be macro influencers or above (over one \nmillion followers is considered to be a mega influencer) \n[40]. Social media users tend to trust the influencers and \nbrands that they follow, [41] and the purpose of this study \nwas to capture information posted by popular Austral-\nian Instagram accounts, therefore, only accounts with \ngreater than 100,000 followers were considered eligible \nfor inclusion. Accounts appearing under the \u201csuggested\u201d \ntab on the Instagram page of included accounts were \nalso screened. Screening was done between May and July \n2021 using an Instagram account made specifically for \nthe project and using Google Chrome\u2019s incognito mode \nto minimise the impact of the algorithm on the sug-\ngested accounts. Two researchers (ED and JV, named in \nacknowledgements) independently screened all accounts \nand disagreements were discussed until agreement was \nreached.\nAll posts by eligible accounts from a twelve-month \nperiod (September 2020 \u2013 September 2021) were down-\nloaded through a paid subscription to Keyhole, an online \nsocial media analytics tool. The data extracted through \nKeyhole included each post\u2019s text-based caption, engage-\nment (sum of likes and comments), the date of upload \nand each account\u2019s bio, number of followers and if it \nwas verified with a blue tick. Each post was manually \nscreened for relevance. Video content including Reels \nand posts that did not refer to one or more component \nof nutrition-related information, as defined in Table\u00a0 1, \nwere excluded. Ten percent of posts were screened inde-\npendently by the lead author (ED) and a research assis-\ntant (JV) for relevance to nutrition information, with 94% \nPage 4 of 14\nDenniss\u00a0et\u00a0al.

The screening resulted in a sample of 10,964 \nInstagram posts containing nutrition-related informa-\ntion, which have been characterised in a previous content \nanalysis study [7].\nFor this study, a random stratified (by Instagram \naccount) subsample of the 10,964 posts were selected and \nscreened further for eligibility. A total of 2,025 posts were \nrandomly selected to be screened (up to 35 posts from \neach of the included Instagram accounts). The random \nsubsample for screening was selected using the sample \nfunction in Stata in March 2022. Posts that promoted a \nproduct but did not include any information about the \nhealth benefits of the product, for example, promotion of \na supplement without mention of its benefits, and posts \nthat only included recipes or meal ideas and no additional \ninformation were excluded because these posts did not \nprovide nutrition guidance that could be evaluated for \naccuracy or quality. All other posts were deemed eligible. \nScreening was done independently by two researchers \n(all posts screened by ED and with secondary screening \nby SM, LM or research assistant JL). Disagreements were \ndiscussed by the two researchers responsible for screen-\ning the relevant post until consensus was reached.\nQuality and\u00a0accuracy evaluations\nThe quality of information was evaluated using the \nPRHISM tool [30]. PRHISM was developed as a tool to \nevaluate the quality of social media-based information \nabout any health-related topic and considers the unique \ncharacteristics of social media content, for example, \ncovert advertising and brevity of information. To the \nknowledge of the authors, PRHISM is the only qual-\nity assessment tool that has been specifically developed \nfor health information delivered via social media. Other \ntools for evaluating the quality of health-related informa-\ntion exist. However, these tools were developed for dif-\nferent settings, such as websites or patient information \npamphlets and their use to evaluate health-related social \nmedia content has been scrutinised in the literature [25, \n42, 43]. PRHISM was developed in a Delphi study, which \ninvolved a panel of 18 expert participants [30]. The par-\nticipants were experts in health communication or a \nhealth-related field, used social media to communicate \nabout health and worked in academia, public health, \ncommunications and/or as health professionals. Three \nDelphi surveys were undertaken to determine group con-\nsensus about the principles to include in PRHISM. Prin-\nciples were based on quality criteria from previous tools \nand adapted to suit social media or were new principles \nsuggested by the expert panel. After the third Delphi sur-\nvey, a draft of the PRHISM scoring tool and guide for use \nwas circulated to participants for feedback about face \nvalidity and participants agreed with the final wording of \nthe principles and guide [30].\nPRHISM consists of thirteen principles that are scored \nfrom zero to four [30]. A number of principles may not \nbe relevant to evaluate depending on the nature of the \nsocial media post being evaluated, for example, principle \n8 relates to privacy and is only relevant to evaluate if the \npost discusses a client or patient. The overall PRHISM \nscore is weighted proportionately as a percentage of the \ntotal available score, whereby principles that are deemed \nnot relevant do not contribute to the total available score. \nThe overall PRHISM score ranges from 0 \u2013 100 where a \nhigher score indicates higher quality. A score of zero to \n25 is considered poor, 26\u2013 50 mediocre, 51 \u2013 75 good \nand 76 \u2013 100 excellent quality [30]. All images and infor-\nmation contained within the post, information in the \naccount holder\u2019s bio and information contained in links \nprovided within the post or bio were considered in qual-\nity evaluations, as outlined in the PRHISM protocol [30]. \nA summary of the PRHISM assessment principles is \nincluded in Table\u00a02.\nTo determine accuracy, the information contained in \nthe Instagram posts was evaluated against information \ncontained in the Australian Dietary Guidelines (ADG) \n[44] Nutrient Reference Values (NRVs), Practice-based \nEvidence in Nutrition Global Resource for Nutrition \nPractice (PEN), [45] and/or Metafact fact-checking plat-\nform. [46] Metafact is a website that enables the public \nto ask questions, which are answered by verified PhDs, \nresearchers and medical specialists.[46] Multiple experts \ncan answer the questions and if\u2009\u2265\u200970% of verified experts \nagree on an answer, it is deemed that consensus has \nbeen achieved [46]. Only questions with consensus were \nused for accuracy evaluations. A large number of posts \nwithin the sample contained claims about the benefits of \ncollagen supplementation for skin health, however, rel-\nevant information was not contained within the chosen \nauthoritative resources. Therefore, a recent systematic \nreview about collagen supplementation was also used to \ndetermine the accuracy of claims about collagen and skin \nhealth [47]. An accuracy coding framework was devel-\noped and was informed by a systematic review of the \nquality and accuracy of online nutrition information [25]. \nPosts were coded as containing information that is com-\npletely inaccurate (0), mostly inaccurate with some accu-\nracies (1), mostly accurate with some inaccuracies (2), \ncompletely accurate (3) or not assessable (4) (see Table\u20092 \nfor descriptions of accuracy categories). All the nutrition \ninformation within a post was considered when evaluat-\ning accuracy. If posts contained information about nutri-\ntion and other topics, such as sleep or exercise, only the \ninformation about nutrition was evaluated. Some posts \ncontained claims about the health benefits of specific \nPage 5 of 14\nDenniss\u00a0et\u00a0al.

In \nthese instances, additional information about the prod-\nuct was sourced from its website in order to evaluate the \naccuracy of the claims.\nAssessments were conducted and recorded in a pur-\npose-designed REDCap database. A set of coding rules \nwas developed to ensure that information that appeared \nmultiple times in the sample of posts was coded consist-\nently for accuracy. Before completing the quality and \naccuracy evaluations, a random 10% if the sample was \nevaluated independently by two authors (ED and LM) for \ninter-rater reliability, achieving 79% agreement for quality \ncategory and 85% for accuracy score. Disagreements \nregarding quality or accuracy evaluations were discussed \nby ED and LM until consensus was reached. Common \nreasons for disagreement were discussed and relevant \nupdates to the study protocol were made before the \nremaining evaluations were completed to improve rigor. \nED conducted the quality and accuracy assessments for \nthe remainder of the sample to further improve consist-\nency. Posts containing information that was difficult to \nevaluate were discussed before reaching a decision. Ins-\ntagram accounts and the topic of Instagram posts were \ninductively categorised. The categories for Instagram \naccounts were developed by the two researchers (ED and \nJV) who undertook the screening of Instagram accounts, \nTable\u202f2\u2002 Summary of quality principles assessed by the PRHISM tool and accuracy score categories\nAbbreviations: PRHISM: Principles for Health-related Information on Social Media\na From: Denniss et\u00a0al.

Int J Behav Nutr Phys Act           (2024) 21:16 \nafter screening had concluded and both researchers were \nimmersed in the data. Each included account was inde-\npendently categorised, and disagreements were discussed \nby ED and JV until agreement was reached. The catego-\nries for Instagram accounts were used in the preceding \nstudy for which the data was originally collected [7]. \nCategories for post topic were developed during the reli-\nability assessments based on the most frequent nutrition-\nrelated topics mentioned in the posts and all posts were \ncategorised by the first author. Descriptions of account \nand topic categories are summarised in Supplementary \nTable\u00a02.\nStatistical analysis\nData was exported from REDCap and statistical analyses \nwere performed in Stata/SE v17.0 (StataCorp, College \nStation, TX). Descriptive statistics were run. Multilevel \nmixed-effects models were used to estimate quality \nscores for account categories, post topics, account veri-\nfication, accuracy score, follower count, engagement, \nand engagement rate. Marginal means of quality scores \nfor account categories and post topics were calculated. \nPairwise comparisons were run to determine mean dif-\nferences in quality scores across account categories, post \ntopics and accuracy categories. Mixed-effects ordered \nlogistic regression models were used to estimate accu-\nracy score outcomes for account categories, post top-\nics, account verification, follower count, engagement \nand engagement rate. Pairwise comparisons were run \nto determine mean differences in quality scores across \naccount categories and post topics. Mixed-effects models \nwere chosen to account for the structure of the data, with \nthe possibility of repeat measures (i.e., multiple posts) \nfor each Instagram account, with posts being the unit \nof analysis and the models including random intercepts \nfor Instagram accounts. Quality and accuracy scores \nwere treated as the dependent variable. Engagement and \nengagement rate had positively skewed distributions and \nwere log transformed. One account had an outlying num-\nber of followers (>\u20092,000,000) and was thus removed from \nanalyses involving follower counts. After removing the \noutlying account, follower counts remained skewed and \nwere also log transformed to achieve normal distribution. \nAnalysis was run with and without the outlying account \nshowing little difference to the result (data not shown). \nStatistical significance was set at P\u2009<\u20090.05.\nEthics\nThe Instagram posts included in this study were pub-\nlicly available. Due to the public nature of the data, this \nstudy was exempt from formal review by an ethics com-\nmittee. To ensure that this study upholds ethical research \nstandards, no identifying information about the account-\nholders has been published.\nResults\nA total of 676 posts from 47 accounts were included in \nthe final sample (Fig.\u00a01, Table\u00a03). Accounts had an aver-\nage of 314,817 followers. The most common topic dis-\ncussed in posts was supplements (36.4%) followed by \nfoods/nutrients and health (17.2%), general healthy eat-\ning (16.0%), weight loss (13.5%), sports/exercise nutrition \n(6.7%), other (5.5%) and paediatric nutrition (4.9%).\nQuality\nOverall, 34.8% (n\u2009=\u2009235) of posts were classified as poor, \n59.2% (n\u2009=\u2009400) mediocre, 6.1% (n\u2009=\u200941) good and zero \nposts were classified as excellent quality. The mean \nPRHISM score was mediocre (31.8\u2009\u00b1\u200910.3 out of a pos-\nsible score of 100) and scores varied across principles \n(Table\u00a0 4). Only two principles had a mean score above \ntwo (4. Financial disclosure and 13. Images) (Table\u00a0 5). \nPosts authored by accounts in the nutritionist/dietitian \ninfluencer account category were associated with higher \nquality scores compared to the reference group (brands) \n(\u03b2, 17.8, CI 13.94\u201321.65; P\u2009<\u20090.001) and all other account \ncategories. Posts that contained information about foods/\nnutrients and health or general healthy eating were \nassociated with higher quality scores compared to the \nreference group (weight loss information) and posts con-\ntaining information about supplements. There was no \nassociation between information quality and accounts \nbeing verified (\u03b2 0.572, P\u2009=\u20090.821) or follower count (\u03b2 \n-1.18, P\u2009=\u20090.643). Lower quality scores were associated \nwith higher engagement (\u03b2 -0.59, P\u2009=\u20090.012) and higher \nengagement rate (\u03b2 -0.57, P\u2009=\u20090.016), although these dif-\nferences were small. A complete summary of the results \nfrom the mixed effects analysis of quality scores by \naccount type and post topic is provided in Supplemen-\ntary Table\u00a03 and 4.\nAccuracy\nFrom the 676 posts included in the sample, 166 were not \nassessable and a total of 510 posts were evaluated for \naccuracy (see Fig.\u00a0 1). Of the posts that were evaluated \nfor accuracy, 44.7% (n\u2009=\u2009228) of posts contained inac-\ncuracies, 8.6% (n\u2009=\u200944) of posts were completely inac-\ncurate, 14.3% (n\u2009=\u200973) mostly inaccurate, 21.8% (111) \nmostly accurate and 55.3% (n\u2009=\u2009282) completely accurate. \nPosts published by fitness influencers had higher odds of \nreceiving a higher score for accuracy compared to posts \npublished by brands (OR 3.09, CI 1.21\u20137.87, P\u2009=\u20090.018) \nas did posts published by nutritionist/dietitian influencer \naccounts (OR 4.69, CI 1.81\u201312.14, P\u2009=\u20090.001).

Int J Behav Nutr Phys Act           (2024) 21:16 \nIntroduction\nPoor diet quality is the leading preventable risk factor \ncontributing to the global burden of non-communica-\nble disease [1]. Dietary behaviours are complex and are \ninfluenced by a range of factors, including hunger, taste \npreferences, food availability, price, societal norms, and \npolicy context [2]. Nutrition information environments, \nwhich encompass the media and advertising, can also \nexert an influence on dietary behaviours [2]. Social media \nhas recently become a prominent part of the modern \nmedia environment and is a popular vehicle for advertis-\ning, marketing and information sharing. Fifty-nine per-\ncent of the global population are active on social media, \n[3] and social media advertising revenue was projected to \nreach $173 billion USD in 2022 [4]. Food and nutrition \nare popular topics on social media platforms, [5, 6] and \nmarketing of food and supplement products has become \nprolific [7, 8]. There is a growing body of evidence that \nindicates food and nutrition content and marketing \non social media has the power to influence food choice \n[9\u201312].\nAs the Internet has become more accessible, individu-\nals have increasingly utilised it to source information \nabout nutrition. Consumers seek nutrition information \nfor various reasons including health management, curi-\nosity, and interest\u00a0 [13]. Nutrition information is con-\ntent that provides the general public with guidance on \nsourcing, storing, preparing and consuming food to sup-\nport good health, and includes recipes, product details, \nhealthy-eating advice and nutritional requirements \n(defined in full in Table\u00a01). Increases in online nutrition \ninformation seeking behaviour have been observed in \nAmerica, [14] Canada, [15] France, [16] and Norway, [17] \nand the Internet is the primary source of nutrition infor-\nmation for Australians [18, 19]. Social media has become \na ubiquitous part of the Internet and consumers search \nfor and follow food and nutrition-related content on \nsocial media [6, 20\u201322]. A survey of American Instagram \nusers found that 87% of female users followed nutrition-\nrelated content on the platform [6]. Consumers not only \nseek information about food and nutrition on social \nmedia they are also passively exposed to it in their social \nmedia feeds without intentionally searching for it [23, \n24]. Due to the influence of social media algorithms and \npaid sponsorships, social media users are also presented \nwith content in their feed from entities that they do not \nfollow. Furthermore, content can be published by anyone, \nregardless of their qualifications, level of expertise in the \ntopic or conflicting interests.\nAccurate and high-quality information is essential \nfor effective health communication and promotion. In \nhealth communication literature, accuracy refers to \nhealth information\u2019s factual correctness, and quality \nrefers to information\u2019s reliability when assessed using \ndefined quality criteria (see Table\u00a0 1) [25, 26]. Quality \nand accuracy are two important but distinct compo-\nnents of information\u2019s overall reliability. It is possible \nfor information to be accurate but of low quality and \nvice versa. Previous studies have assessed the accu-\nracy of online nutrition information against authorita-\ntive sources such as dietary guidelines, authoritative \nreports and peer reviewed literature [25]. Numerous \nquality assessment tools have been used to evaluate \nthe quality of online nutrition information, such as the \nDISCERN Instrument, [27]. Journal of the American \nMedical Association Benchmarks, [28] and Health on \nthe Net Code Principles [7, 29]. These tools share com-\nmon quality criteria, such as, declaring financial inter-\nests, citing sources, authorship by an individual with \nrelevant health-related qualifications, and disclosure of \nthe author\u2019s qualifications. Principles for Health-related \nInformation on Social Media (PRHISM), is a recently \ndeveloped quality assessment tool, which includes \nthese established quality principles and additional \nprinciples that are relevant to social media, including \naccessibility and readability [30]. There is a broad con-\nsensus in the literature that health information of sub-\noptimal quality and accuracy is extremely prevalent on \nsocial media [26, 31]. Concerningly, misinformation is \noften more popular than truthful information, receives \nhigher user engagement and spreads more quickly than \nthe truth due to its novelty [31, 32]. Furthermore, the \nnarrative of health misinformation often includes and \npromotes mistrust in authoritative institutions and \nTable\u202f1\u2002 Key definitions\na From Denniss et\u00a0al. [25]\nAccuracy: The factual correctness of\u00a0information when\u00a0compared to\u00a0authoritative sources of\u00a0information such as\u00a0systematic reviews, meta analyses \nor\u00a0national dietary guidelines [25].\nQuality: The reliability of\u00a0information as\u00a0assessed by\u00a0quality criteria [26]. Quality criteria typically include components such as\u00a0readability, inclusion of\u00a0ref-\nerences, transparency about\u00a0financial interests and\u00a0disclosure of\u00a0the\u00a0author\u2019s identity and\u00a0qualifications\naNutrition-related information: information regarding\u00a0healthy eating, dietary patterns, nutrients, nutritional requirements, nutritional composition \nof\u00a0foods, nutritional supplements, health outcomes associated with\u00a0foods and\u00a0dietary patterns, food safety, food ethics, cooking and\u00a0recipes intended \nfor\u00a0the\u00a0general public [25].\nPage 3 of 14\nDenniss\u00a0et\u00a0al. Int J Behav Nutr Phys Act           (2024) 21:16 \n\t\nexperts [31]. Social media-based misinformation can \nhave consequences for public health, for example, the \nonline anti-vaccination movement is believed to have \ncontributed to a reduction in vaccination rates and the \nreemergence of previously eradicated communicable \ndiseases [31, 33].\nPublic health nutrition experts and organisations have \nraised concerns about the potential for nutrition-related \nmisinformation to cause serious harm and undermine \ncredible nutrition communication. Exposure to nutri-\ntion information that lacks context or contradicts previ-\nous messaging can lead to confusion and backlash, which \nhas been evidenced to reduce consumers\u2019 willingness \nto engage in healthful behaviours and accept advice by \nauthoritative nutrition experts [34, 35]. If dietary behav-\niours are based on misinformation that contradicts evi-\ndence-based dietary guidelines, it may put individuals at \ngreater risk of developing non-communicable diseases \nthat are associated with unhealthy dietary patterns [1]. A \nrecent systematic review of studies evaluating the quality \nand accuracy of nutrition-related information published \non websites and social media found that generally infor-\nmation was of suboptimal quality and accuracy [25]. A \nsmall number of studies in the review investigated cer-\ntain social media (e.g., blogs, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter \nand WhatsApp), meaning other platforms, such as Insta-\ngram have had limited attention [25]. A further limitation \nwas that quality assessment tools designed for different \nsettings, for example, websites, were used to evaluate the \nsocial media content [25]. Furthermore, it was also rare \nfor studies to involve multiple researchers when screen-\ning posts to evaluate, which is a potential source of bias \n[25]. One recent study that was not captured within the \ndate-range of the systematic review examined the qual-\nity of nutrition-related information on Instagram find-\ning that quality was extremely low [36]. However, this \nstudy measured quality as a single criterion, rather than \nusing an extensive quality assessment method, and thus \nmay not have comprehensively measured the quality of \ninformation.\nTo the knowledge of the authors, thus far no studies \nhave assessed the accuracy of nutrition information on \nInstagram, and none have used social media specific tools \nto evaluate the quality of nutrition-related Instagram \ncontent. Instagram was the third most popular social \nmedia platform in Australia, and the fifth most visited \nwebsite in the world in 2021, [3,\u00a037] and nutrition is one \nof the most frequently discussed health topics on Insta-\ngram [5]. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evalu-\nate the quality and accuracy of nutrition information \nposted by popular Australian Instagram accounts using \nthe PRHISM tool to assess quality. A secondary aim was \nto examine trends in information quality and accuracy by \nauthor, topic, post engagement, account verification and \nnumber of followers.\nMethods\nStudy design and\u00a0data collection\nThe present study involved a cross-sectional evaluation \nof the quality and accuracy of nutrition-related infor-\nmation published on Instagram by Australian influencer \nor brand accounts. The Strengthening the Reporting of \nObservational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guide-\nlines were followed and the checklist is available in Sup-\nplementary Table\u00a01 [38]. A subsample of Instagram posts \ncollected for a wider project formed the dataset for this \nstudy and data collection has been described in detail \nelsewhere [7]. Briefly, a list of the top 1,000 Australian \nhealth Instagram accounts as of April 2021 was screened \nto determine eligibility [39]. Australian accounts with \nover 100,000 followers, a minimum of 100 posts, their \nmost recent post published within two weeks, and a \nminimum of 25% of their content relating to nutrition \nwere included. The figure of 100,000 followers was cho-\nsen because accounts with over 100,000 followers are \nconsidered to be macro influencers or above (over one \nmillion followers is considered to be a mega influencer) \n[40]. Social media users tend to trust the influencers and \nbrands that they follow, [41] and the purpose of this study \nwas to capture information posted by popular Austral-\nian Instagram accounts, therefore, only accounts with \ngreater than 100,000 followers were considered eligible \nfor inclusion. Accounts appearing under the \u201csuggested\u201d \ntab on the Instagram page of included accounts were \nalso screened. Screening was done between May and July \n2021 using an Instagram account made specifically for \nthe project and using Google Chrome\u2019s incognito mode \nto minimise the impact of the algorithm on the sug-\ngested accounts. Two researchers (ED and JV, named in \nacknowledgements) independently screened all accounts \nand disagreements were discussed until agreement was \nreached.\nAll posts by eligible accounts from a twelve-month \nperiod (September 2020 \u2013 September 2021) were down-\nloaded through a paid subscription to Keyhole, an online \nsocial media analytics tool. The data extracted through \nKeyhole included each post\u2019s text-based caption, engage-\nment (sum of likes and comments), the date of upload \nand each account\u2019s bio, number of followers and if it \nwas verified with a blue tick. Each post was manually \nscreened for relevance. Video content including Reels \nand posts that did not refer to one or more component \nof nutrition-related information, as defined in Table\u00a0 1, \nwere excluded. Ten percent of posts were screened inde-\npendently by the lead author (ED) and a research assis-\ntant (JV) for relevance to nutrition information, with 94% \nPage 4 of 14\nDenniss\u00a0et\u00a0al. Int J Behav Nutr Phys Act           (2024) 21:16 \nagreement. The screening resulted in a sample of 10,964 \nInstagram posts containing nutrition-related informa-\ntion, which have been characterised in a previous content \nanalysis study [7].\nFor this study, a random stratified (by Instagram \naccount) subsample of the 10,964 posts were selected and \nscreened further for eligibility. A total of 2,025 posts were \nrandomly selected to be screened (up to 35 posts from \neach of the included Instagram accounts). The random \nsubsample for screening was selected using the sample \nfunction in Stata in March 2022. Posts that promoted a \nproduct but did not include any information about the \nhealth benefits of the product, for example, promotion of \na supplement without mention of its benefits, and posts \nthat only included recipes or meal ideas and no additional \ninformation were excluded because these posts did not \nprovide nutrition guidance that could be evaluated for \naccuracy or quality. All other posts were deemed eligible. \nScreening was done independently by two researchers \n(all posts screened by ED and with secondary screening \nby SM, LM or research assistant JL). Disagreements were \ndiscussed by the two researchers responsible for screen-\ning the relevant post until consensus was reached.\nQuality and\u00a0accuracy evaluations\nThe quality of information was evaluated using the \nPRHISM tool [30]. PRHISM was developed as a tool to \nevaluate the quality of social media-based information \nabout any health-related topic and considers the unique \ncharacteristics of social media content, for example, \ncovert advertising and brevity of information. To the \nknowledge of the authors, PRHISM is the only qual-\nity assessment tool that has been specifically developed \nfor health information delivered via social media. Other \ntools for evaluating the quality of health-related informa-\ntion exist. However, these tools were developed for dif-\nferent settings, such as websites or patient information \npamphlets and their use to evaluate health-related social \nmedia content has been scrutinised in the literature [25, \n42, 43]. PRHISM was developed in a Delphi study, which \ninvolved a panel of 18 expert participants [30]. The par-\nticipants were experts in health communication or a \nhealth-related field, used social media to communicate \nabout health and worked in academia, public health, \ncommunications and/or as health professionals. Three \nDelphi surveys were undertaken to determine group con-\nsensus about the principles to include in PRHISM. Prin-\nciples were based on quality criteria from previous tools \nand adapted to suit social media or were new principles \nsuggested by the expert panel. After the third Delphi sur-\nvey, a draft of the PRHISM scoring tool and guide for use \nwas circulated to participants for feedback about face \nvalidity and participants agreed with the final wording of \nthe principles and guide [30].\nPRHISM consists of thirteen principles that are scored \nfrom zero to four [30]. A number of principles may not \nbe relevant to evaluate depending on the nature of the \nsocial media post being evaluated, for example, principle \n8 relates to privacy and is only relevant to evaluate if the \npost discusses a client or patient. The overall PRHISM \nscore is weighted proportionately as a percentage of the \ntotal available score, whereby principles that are deemed \nnot relevant do not contribute to the total available score. \nThe overall PRHISM score ranges from 0 \u2013 100 where a \nhigher score indicates higher quality. A score of zero to \n25 is considered poor, 26\u2013 50 mediocre, 51 \u2013 75 good \nand 76 \u2013 100 excellent quality [30]. All images and infor-\nmation contained within the post, information in the \naccount holder\u2019s bio and information contained in links \nprovided within the post or bio were considered in qual-\nity evaluations, as outlined in the PRHISM protocol [30]. \nA summary of the PRHISM assessment principles is \nincluded in Table\u00a02.\nTo determine accuracy, the information contained in \nthe Instagram posts was evaluated against information \ncontained in the Australian Dietary Guidelines (ADG) \n[44] Nutrient Reference Values (NRVs), Practice-based \nEvidence in Nutrition Global Resource for Nutrition \nPractice (PEN), [45] and/or Metafact fact-checking plat-\nform. [46] Metafact is a website that enables the public \nto ask questions, which are answered by verified PhDs, \nresearchers and medical specialists.[46] Multiple experts \ncan answer the questions and if\u2009\u2265\u200970% of verified experts \nagree on an answer, it is deemed that consensus has \nbeen achieved [46]. Only questions with consensus were \nused for accuracy evaluations. A large number of posts \nwithin the sample contained claims about the benefits of \ncollagen supplementation for skin health, however, rel-\nevant information was not contained within the chosen \nauthoritative resources. Therefore, a recent systematic \nreview about collagen supplementation was also used to \ndetermine the accuracy of claims about collagen and skin \nhealth [47]. An accuracy coding framework was devel-\noped and was informed by a systematic review of the \nquality and accuracy of online nutrition information [25]. \nPosts were coded as containing information that is com-\npletely inaccurate (0), mostly inaccurate with some accu-\nracies (1), mostly accurate with some inaccuracies (2), \ncompletely accurate (3) or not assessable (4) (see Table\u20092 \nfor descriptions of accuracy categories). All the nutrition \ninformation within a post was considered when evaluat-\ning accuracy. If posts contained information about nutri-\ntion and other topics, such as sleep or exercise, only the \ninformation about nutrition was evaluated. Some posts \ncontained claims about the health benefits of specific \nPage 5 of 14\nDenniss\u00a0et\u00a0al.

In \nthese instances, additional information about the prod-\nuct was sourced from its website in order to evaluate the \naccuracy of the claims.\nAssessments were conducted and recorded in a pur-\npose-designed REDCap database. A set of coding rules \nwas developed to ensure that information that appeared \nmultiple times in the sample of posts was coded consist-\nently for accuracy. Before completing the quality and \naccuracy evaluations, a random 10% if the sample was \nevaluated independently by two authors (ED and LM) for \ninter-rater reliability, achieving 79% agreement for quality \ncategory and 85% for accuracy score. Disagreements \nregarding quality or accuracy evaluations were discussed \nby ED and LM until consensus was reached. Common \nreasons for disagreement were discussed and relevant \nupdates to the study protocol were made before the \nremaining evaluations were completed to improve rigor. \nED conducted the quality and accuracy assessments for \nthe remainder of the sample to further improve consist-\nency. Posts containing information that was difficult to \nevaluate were discussed before reaching a decision. Ins-\ntagram accounts and the topic of Instagram posts were \ninductively categorised. The categories for Instagram \naccounts were developed by the two researchers (ED and \nJV) who undertook the screening of Instagram accounts, \nTable\u202f2\u2002 Summary of quality principles assessed by the PRHISM tool and accuracy score categories\nAbbreviations: PRHISM: Principles for Health-related Information on Social Media\na From: Denniss et\u00a0al.

Each included account was inde-\npendently categorised, and disagreements were discussed \nby ED and JV until agreement was reached. The catego-\nries for Instagram accounts were used in the preceding \nstudy for which the data was originally collected [7]. \nCategories for post topic were developed during the reli-\nability assessments based on the most frequent nutrition-\nrelated topics mentioned in the posts and all posts were \ncategorised by the first author. Descriptions of account \nand topic categories are summarised in Supplementary \nTable\u00a02.\nStatistical analysis\nData was exported from REDCap and statistical analyses \nwere performed in Stata/SE v17.0 (StataCorp, College \nStation, TX). Descriptive statistics were run. Multilevel \nmixed-effects models were used to estimate quality \nscores for account categories, post topics, account veri-\nfication, accuracy score, follower count, engagement, \nand engagement rate. Marginal means of quality scores \nfor account categories and post topics were calculated. \nPairwise comparisons were run to determine mean dif-\nferences in quality scores across account categories, post \ntopics and accuracy categories. Mixed-effects ordered \nlogistic regression models were used to estimate accu-\nracy score outcomes for account categories, post top-\nics, account verification, follower count, engagement \nand engagement rate. Pairwise comparisons were run \nto determine mean differences in quality scores across \naccount categories and post topics. Mixed-effects models \nwere chosen to account for the structure of the data, with \nthe possibility of repeat measures (i.e., multiple posts) \nfor each Instagram account, with posts being the unit \nof analysis and the models including random intercepts \nfor Instagram accounts. Quality and accuracy scores \nwere treated as the dependent variable. Engagement and \nengagement rate had positively skewed distributions and \nwere log transformed. One account had an outlying num-\nber of followers (>\u20092,000,000) and was thus removed from \nanalyses involving follower counts. After removing the \noutlying account, follower counts remained skewed and \nwere also log transformed to achieve normal distribution. \nAnalysis was run with and without the outlying account \nshowing little difference to the result (data not shown). \nStatistical significance was set at P\u2009<\u20090.05.\nEthics\nThe Instagram posts included in this study were pub-\nlicly available. Due to the public nature of the data, this \nstudy was exempt from formal review by an ethics com-\nmittee. To ensure that this study upholds ethical research \nstandards, no identifying information about the account-\nholders has been published.\nResults\nA total of 676 posts from 47 accounts were included in \nthe final sample (Fig.\u00a01, Table\u00a03). Accounts had an aver-\nage of 314,817 followers. The most common topic dis-\ncussed in posts was supplements (36.4%) followed by \nfoods/nutrients and health (17.2%), general healthy eat-\ning (16.0%), weight loss (13.5%), sports/exercise nutrition \n(6.7%), other (5.5%) and paediatric nutrition (4.9%).\nQuality\nOverall, 34.8% (n\u2009=\u2009235) of posts were classified as poor, \n59.2% (n\u2009=\u2009400) mediocre, 6.1% (n\u2009=\u200941) good and zero \nposts were classified as excellent quality. The mean \nPRHISM score was mediocre (31.8\u2009\u00b1\u200910.3 out of a pos-\nsible score of 100) and scores varied across principles \n(Table\u00a0 4). Only two principles had a mean score above \ntwo (4. Financial disclosure and 13. Images) (Table\u00a0 5). \nPosts authored by accounts in the nutritionist/dietitian \ninfluencer account category were associated with higher \nquality scores compared to the reference group (brands) \n(\u03b2, 17.8, CI 13.94\u201321.65; P\u2009<\u20090.001) and all other account \ncategories. Posts that contained information about foods/\nnutrients and health or general healthy eating were \nassociated with higher quality scores compared to the \nreference group (weight loss information) and posts con-\ntaining information about supplements. There was no \nassociation between information quality and accounts \nbeing verified (\u03b2 0.572, P\u2009=\u20090.821) or follower count (\u03b2 \n-1.18, P\u2009=\u20090.643). Lower quality scores were associated \nwith higher engagement (\u03b2 -0.59, P\u2009=\u20090.012) and higher \nengagement rate (\u03b2 -0.57, P\u2009=\u20090.016), although these dif-\nferences were small. A complete summary of the results \nfrom the mixed effects analysis of quality scores by \naccount type and post topic is provided in Supplemen-\ntary Table\u00a03 and 4.\nAccuracy\nFrom the 676 posts included in the sample, 166 were not \nassessable and a total of 510 posts were evaluated for \naccuracy (see Fig.\u00a0 1). Of the posts that were evaluated \nfor accuracy, 44.7% (n\u2009=\u2009228) of posts contained inac-\ncuracies, 8.6% (n\u2009=\u200944) of posts were completely inac-\ncurate, 14.3% (n\u2009=\u200973) mostly inaccurate, 21.8% (111) \nmostly accurate and 55.3% (n\u2009=\u2009282) completely accurate. \nPosts published by fitness influencers had higher odds of \nreceiving a higher score for accuracy compared to posts \npublished by brands (OR 3.09, CI 1.21\u20137.87, P\u2009=\u20090.018) \nas did posts published by nutritionist/dietitian influencer \naccounts (OR 4.69, CI 1.81\u201312.14, P\u2009=\u20090.001).

There was no difference in \nquality scores observed for posts containing mostly inac-\ncurate or mostly accurate information.\nDiscussion\nThis content analysis study evaluated the quality and \naccuracy of nutrition-related information posted by \npopular Australian Instagram accounts. Results indicate \nFig.\u202f1\u2002 Flow chart of\u00a0sample selection process\nPage 8 of 14\nDenniss\u00a0et\u00a0al. Int J Behav Nutr Phys Act           (2024) 21:16 \nthat most information posted by Australian accounts is of \nlow to moderate quality and almost half of posts contain \ninaccuracies. Information about supplements or posted \nby brand accounts tended to be of lower quality and \naccuracy compared to other topics and authors of infor-\nmation. Australian nutritionist and dietitian accounts \nposted higher quality information that was more likely to \nbe accurate.\nOverall, the quality and accuracy of nutrition-related \nInstagram posts included in this study was poor and \nposts that were of lower quality received higher engage-\nment. These findings are consistent with content analyses \nof nutrition-related information from YouTube, [48\u201351] \nInstagram, [36] WhatsApp, [52] Twitter, [53] Facebook, \n[54] and blogs, [55] which found large proportions of \ninaccurate and poor quality information. Furthermore, a \nstudy on YouTube videos about nutrition following bari-\natric surgery found that poor quality and inaccurate vid-\neos were the most popular [50]. Conversely, studies about \nhealthy eating information on blogs [56] and information \nabout food safety and eating for coeliac disease on You-\nTube [57, 58] have found information to be accurate and \nof fair to high quality. More broadly, studies about health-\nrelated information on social media have found that \nhealth misinformation is abundant on social media plat-\nforms and is often more popular than factual information \n[31]. A small association between information accuracy \nand quality was observed, which is consistent with previ-\nous research that has seen a very weak correlation [59] \nor no correlation [60] between the quality and accuracy \nof nutrition-related information. Findings from this study \nand the health and nutrition communication literature \nsuggest that Instagram and other social media users are \nlikely to be exposed to suboptimal and misleading nutri-\ntion information. Furthermore, over a third of posts in \nthis study contained a combination of accurate and inac-\ncurate information, which may make it difficult for con-\nsumers to identify accurate information when engaging \nwith nutrition-related posts by Australian accounts. The \ngenerally low PRHISM scores that Australian accounts \nreceived suggest that consumers may be presented with \ninformation that is difficult to understand and lacks suf-\nficient context or evidence, which may undermine public \nhealth nutrition efforts and contribute to confusion and \nbacklash [34, 35].\nInformation about supplements and information \nposted by brand accounts was of the lowest quality and \naccuracy consistent with existing research. A systematic \nreview of the quality and accuracy of online nutrition \ninformation found that information published by com-\nmercial entities was often of the lowest quality and accu-\nracy, however, this finding was not consistent throughout \nthe included studies and there was variation in which \npublishers provided the most reliable information [25]. \nThe same review also found that information about sup-\nplements was typically inaccurate and of low quality [25]. \nSimilarly, Basch et\u00a0al. found that YouTube videos about \nmultivitamin supplements were of poor quality, [49] and \na small analysis of Instagram posts containing #immune-\nbooster found numerous inaccurate claims about the \nimmune boosting benefits of supplements during the \nCOVID-19 pandemic [61]. Marketing from brands and \ninfluencers dominates social media and the marketing of \nsupplements is prevalent on Instagram [4, 7]. The inac-\ncurate and poor-quality information about supplements \nand posted by Australian brand accounts observed in \nthis study may indicate that exaggerated information may \nbe used as a marketing tactic on Instagram. While con-\nsumers should be critical of nutrition information pro-\nvided by commercial entities or alongside the marketing \nTable\u202f3\u2002 Characteristics of Instagram accounts (n\u2009=\u200947) and Instagram posts (n\u2009=\u2009676) included in total sample\nInstagram \naccount \ncategory (n)\nTotal posts \nin sample \nn (%)\nFollowers \n(mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard \ndeviation)\nPost topic n (%)\nWeight loss Sports/\nexercise \nnutrition\nSupplements\nFoods/\nnutrients & \nhealth\nGeneral \nhealthy \neating\nPaediatric \nnutrition\nOther\nAll (47)\n676 (100)\n271,789\u2009\u00b1\u2009293,101\n91 (13.5)\n45 (6.7)\n246 (36.4)\n116 (17.2)\n108 (16.0)\n33 (4.9)\n37 (5.5)\nBy account category\n\u2003 Brand (22)\n328 (48.5)\n230,188\u2009\u00b1\u200996,768\n33 (10.1)\n5 (1.5)\n208 (63.4)\n50 (15.2)\n26 (7.9)\n0 (0)\n7 (2.1)\n\u2003 \u2003 Fitness/\ncoaching \ninfluencer (9)\n146 (21.6)\n448,946\u2009\u00b1\u2009626,286\n46 (31.5)\n39 (26.7)\n23 (15.8)\n12 (8.2)\n23 (15.8)\n0 (0)\n3 (2.1)\n\u2003 Lifestyle \ninfluencer (8)\n57 (8.4)\n285,787\u2009\u00b1\u2009152,421\n3 (5.3)\n0 (0)\n11 (19.3)\n18 (31.6)\n19 (33.3)\n0 (0)\n6 (10.5)\n\u2003 Nutrition-\nist/dietitian \ninfluencer (8)\n145 (21.4)\n172,888\u2009\u00b1\u200988,051\n9 (6.2)\n1 (0.7)\n4 (2.8)\n36 (24.8)\n41 (28.3)\n33 (22.8)\n21 (14.5)\n"

Int J Behav Nutr Phys Act           (2024) 21:16 \nIntroduction\nPoor diet quality is the leading preventable risk factor \ncontributing to the global burden of non-communica-\nble disease [1]. Dietary behaviours are complex and are \ninfluenced by a range of factors, including hunger, taste \npreferences, food availability, price, societal norms, and \npolicy context [2]. Nutrition information environments, \nwhich encompass the media and advertising, can also \nexert an influence on dietary behaviours [2]. Social media \nhas recently become a prominent part of the modern \nmedia environment and is a popular vehicle for advertis-\ning, marketing and information sharing. Fifty-nine per-\ncent of the global population are active on social media, \n[3] and social media advertising revenue was projected to \nreach $173 billion USD in 2022 [4]. Food and nutrition \nare popular topics on social media platforms, [5, 6] and \nmarketing of food and supplement products has become \nprolific [7, 8]. There is a growing body of evidence that \nindicates food and nutrition content and marketing \non social media has the power to influence food choice \n[9\u201312].\nAs the Internet has become more accessible, individu-\nals have increasingly utilised it to source information \nabout nutrition. Consumers seek nutrition information \nfor various reasons including health management, curi-\nosity, and interest\u00a0 [13]. Nutrition information is con-\ntent that provides the general public with guidance on \nsourcing, storing, preparing and consuming food to sup-\nport good health, and includes recipes, product details, \nhealthy-eating advice and nutritional requirements \n(defined in full in Table\u00a01). Increases in online nutrition \ninformation seeking behaviour have been observed in \nAmerica, [14] Canada, [15] France, [16] and Norway, [17] \nand the Internet is the primary source of nutrition infor-\nmation for Australians [18, 19]. Social media has become \na ubiquitous part of the Internet and consumers search \nfor and follow food and nutrition-related content on \nsocial media [6, 20\u201322]. A survey of American Instagram \nusers found that 87% of female users followed nutrition-\nrelated content on the platform [6]. Consumers not only \nseek information about food and nutrition on social \nmedia they are also passively exposed to it in their social \nmedia feeds without intentionally searching for it [23, \n24]. Due to the influence of social media algorithms and \npaid sponsorships, social media users are also presented \nwith content in their feed from entities that they do not \nfollow. Furthermore, content can be published by anyone, \nregardless of their qualifications, level of expertise in the \ntopic or conflicting interests.\nAccurate and high-quality information is essential \nfor effective health communication and promotion. In \nhealth communication literature, accuracy refers to \nhealth information\u2019s factual correctness, and quality \nrefers to information\u2019s reliability when assessed using \ndefined quality criteria (see Table\u00a0 1) [25, 26]. Quality \nand accuracy are two important but distinct compo-\nnents of information\u2019s overall reliability. It is possible \nfor information to be accurate but of low quality and \nvice versa. Previous studies have assessed the accu-\nracy of online nutrition information against authorita-\ntive sources such as dietary guidelines, authoritative \nreports and peer reviewed literature [25]. Numerous \nquality assessment tools have been used to evaluate \nthe quality of online nutrition information, such as the \nDISCERN Instrument, [27]. Journal of the American \nMedical Association Benchmarks, [28] and Health on \nthe Net Code Principles [7, 29]. These tools share com-\nmon quality criteria, such as, declaring financial inter-\nests, citing sources, authorship by an individual with \nrelevant health-related qualifications, and disclosure of \nthe author\u2019s qualifications. Principles for Health-related \nInformation on Social Media (PRHISM), is a recently \ndeveloped quality assessment tool, which includes \nthese established quality principles and additional \nprinciples that are relevant to social media, including \naccessibility and readability [30]. There is a broad con-\nsensus in the literature that health information of sub-\noptimal quality and accuracy is extremely prevalent on \nsocial media [26, 31]. Concerningly, misinformation is \noften more popular than truthful information, receives \nhigher user engagement and spreads more quickly than \nthe truth due to its novelty [31, 32]. Furthermore, the \nnarrative of health misinformation often includes and \npromotes mistrust in authoritative institutions and \nTable\u202f1\u2002 Key definitions\na From Denniss et\u00a0al. [25]\nAccuracy: The factual correctness of\u00a0information when\u00a0compared to\u00a0authoritative sources of\u00a0information such as\u00a0systematic reviews, meta analyses \nor\u00a0national dietary guidelines [25].\nQuality: The reliability of\u00a0information as\u00a0assessed by\u00a0quality criteria [26]. Quality criteria typically include components such as\u00a0readability, inclusion of\u00a0ref-\nerences, transparency about\u00a0financial interests and\u00a0disclosure of\u00a0the\u00a0author\u2019s identity and\u00a0qualifications\naNutrition-related information: information regarding\u00a0healthy eating, dietary patterns, nutrients, nutritional requirements, nutritional composition \nof\u00a0foods, nutritional supplements, health outcomes associated with\u00a0foods and\u00a0dietary patterns, food safety, food ethics, cooking and\u00a0recipes intended \nfor\u00a0the\u00a0general public [25].\nPage 3 of 14\nDenniss\u00a0et\u00a0al. Int J Behav Nutr Phys Act           (2024) 21:16 \n\t\nexperts [31]. Social media-based misinformation can \nhave consequences for public health, for example, the \nonline anti-vaccination movement is believed to have \ncontributed to a reduction in vaccination rates and the \nreemergence of previously eradicated communicable \ndiseases [31, 33].\nPublic health nutrition experts and organisations have \nraised concerns about the potential for nutrition-related \nmisinformation to cause serious harm and undermine \ncredible nutrition communication. Exposure to nutri-\ntion information that lacks context or contradicts previ-\nous messaging can lead to confusion and backlash, which \nhas been evidenced to reduce consumers\u2019 willingness \nto engage in healthful behaviours and accept advice by \nauthoritative nutrition experts [34, 35]. If dietary behav-\niours are based on misinformation that contradicts evi-\ndence-based dietary guidelines, it may put individuals at \ngreater risk of developing non-communicable diseases \nthat are associated with unhealthy dietary patterns [1]. A \nrecent systematic review of studies evaluating the quality \nand accuracy of nutrition-related information published \non websites and social media found that generally infor-\nmation was of suboptimal quality and accuracy [25]. A \nsmall number of studies in the review investigated cer-\ntain social media (e.g., blogs, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter \nand WhatsApp), meaning other platforms, such as Insta-\ngram have had limited attention [25]. A further limitation \nwas that quality assessment tools designed for different \nsettings, for example, websites, were used to evaluate the \nsocial media content [25]. Furthermore, it was also rare \nfor studies to involve multiple researchers when screen-\ning posts to evaluate, which is a potential source of bias \n[25]. One recent study that was not captured within the \ndate-range of the systematic review examined the qual-\nity of nutrition-related information on Instagram find-\ning that quality was extremely low [36]. However, this \nstudy measured quality as a single criterion, rather than \nusing an extensive quality assessment method, and thus \nmay not have comprehensively measured the quality of \ninformation.\nTo the knowledge of the authors, thus far no studies \nhave assessed the accuracy of nutrition information on \nInstagram, and none have used social media specific tools \nto evaluate the quality of nutrition-related Instagram \ncontent. Instagram was the third most popular social \nmedia platform in Australia, and the fifth most visited \nwebsite in the world in 2021, [3,\u00a037] and nutrition is one \nof the most frequently discussed health topics on Insta-\ngram [5]. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evalu-\nate the quality and accuracy of nutrition information \nposted by popular Australian Instagram accounts using \nthe PRHISM tool to assess quality. A secondary aim was \nto examine trends in information quality and accuracy by \nauthor, topic, post engagement, account verification and \nnumber of followers.\nMethods\nStudy design and\u00a0data collection\nThe present study involved a cross-sectional evaluation \nof the quality and accuracy of nutrition-related infor-\nmation published on Instagram by Australian influencer \nor brand accounts. The Strengthening the Reporting of \nObservational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guide-\nlines were followed and the checklist is available in Sup-\nplementary Table\u00a01 [38]. A subsample of Instagram posts \ncollected for a wider project formed the dataset for this \nstudy and data collection has been described in detail \nelsewhere [7]. Briefly, a list of the top 1,000 Australian \nhealth Instagram accounts as of April 2021 was screened \nto determine eligibility [39]. Australian accounts with \nover 100,000 followers, a minimum of 100 posts, their \nmost recent post published within two weeks, and a \nminimum of 25% of their content relating to nutrition \nwere included. The figure of 100,000 followers was cho-\nsen because accounts with over 100,000 followers are \nconsidered to be macro influencers or above (over one \nmillion followers is considered to be a mega influencer) \n[40]. Social media users tend to trust the influencers and \nbrands that they follow, [41] and the purpose of this study \nwas to capture information posted by popular Austral-\nian Instagram accounts, therefore, only accounts with \ngreater than 100,000 followers were considered eligible \nfor inclusion. Accounts appearing under the \u201csuggested\u201d \ntab on the Instagram page of included accounts were \nalso screened. Screening was done between May and July \n2021 using an Instagram account made specifically for \nthe project and using Google Chrome\u2019s incognito mode \nto minimise the impact of the algorithm on the sug-\ngested accounts. Two researchers (ED and JV, named in \nacknowledgements) independently screened all accounts \nand disagreements were discussed until agreement was \nreached.\nAll posts by eligible accounts from a twelve-month \nperiod (September 2020 \u2013 September 2021) were down-\nloaded through a paid subscription to Keyhole, an online \nsocial media analytics tool. The data extracted through \nKeyhole included each post\u2019s text-based caption, engage-\nment (sum of likes and comments), the date of upload \nand each account\u2019s bio, number of followers and if it \nwas verified with a blue tick. Each post was manually \nscreened for relevance. Video content including Reels \nand posts that did not refer to one or more component \nof nutrition-related information, as defined in Table\u00a0 1, \nwere excluded. Ten percent of posts were screened inde-\npendently by the lead author (ED) and a research assis-\ntant (JV) for relevance to nutrition information, with 94% \nPage 4 of 14\nDenniss\u00a0et\u00a0al. Int J Behav Nutr Phys Act           (2024) 21:16 \nagreement. The screening resulted in a sample of 10,964 \nInstagram posts containing nutrition-related informa-\ntion, which have been characterised in a previous content \nanalysis study [7].\nFor this study, a random stratified (by Instagram \naccount) subsample of the 10,964 posts were selected and \nscreened further for eligibility. A total of 2,025 posts were \nrandomly selected to be screened (up to 35 posts from \neach of the included Instagram accounts). The random \nsubsample for screening was selected using the sample \nfunction in Stata in March 2022. Posts that promoted a \nproduct but did not include any information about the \nhealth benefits of the product, for example, promotion of \na supplement without mention of its benefits, and posts \nthat only included recipes or meal ideas and no additional \ninformation were excluded because these posts did not \nprovide nutrition guidance that could be evaluated for \naccuracy or quality. All other posts were deemed eligible. \nScreening was done independently by two researchers \n(all posts screened by ED and with secondary screening \nby SM, LM or research assistant JL). Disagreements were \ndiscussed by the two researchers responsible for screen-\ning the relevant post until consensus was reached.\nQuality and\u00a0accuracy evaluations\nThe quality of information was evaluated using the \nPRHISM tool [30]. PRHISM was developed as a tool to \nevaluate the quality of social media-based information \nabout any health-related topic and considers the unique \ncharacteristics of social media content, for example, \ncovert advertising and brevity of information. To the \nknowledge of the authors, PRHISM is the only qual-\nity assessment tool that has been specifically developed \nfor health information delivered via social media. Other \ntools for evaluating the quality of health-related informa-\ntion exist. However, these tools were developed for dif-\nferent settings, such as websites or patient information \npamphlets and their use to evaluate health-related social \nmedia content has been scrutinised in the literature [25, \n42, 43]. PRHISM was developed in a Delphi study, which \ninvolved a panel of 18 expert participants [30]. The par-\nticipants were experts in health communication or a \nhealth-related field, used social media to communicate \nabout health and worked in academia, public health, \ncommunications and/or as health professionals. Three \nDelphi surveys were undertaken to determine group con-\nsensus about the principles to include in PRHISM. Prin-\nciples were based on quality criteria from previous tools \nand adapted to suit social media or were new principles \nsuggested by the expert panel. After the third Delphi sur-\nvey, a draft of the PRHISM scoring tool and guide for use \nwas circulated to participants for feedback about face \nvalidity and participants agreed with the final wording of \nthe principles and guide [30].\nPRHISM consists of thirteen principles that are scored \nfrom zero to four [30]. A number of principles may not \nbe relevant to evaluate depending on the nature of the \nsocial media post being evaluated, for example, principle \n8 relates to privacy and is only relevant to evaluate if the \npost discusses a client or patient. The overall PRHISM \nscore is weighted proportionately as a percentage of the \ntotal available score, whereby principles that are deemed \nnot relevant do not contribute to the total available score. \nThe overall PRHISM score ranges from 0 \u2013 100 where a \nhigher score indicates higher quality. A score of zero to \n25 is considered poor, 26\u2013 50 mediocre, 51 \u2013 75 good \nand 76 \u2013 100 excellent quality [30]. All images and infor-\nmation contained within the post, information in the \naccount holder\u2019s bio and information contained in links \nprovided within the post or bio were considered in qual-\nity evaluations, as outlined in the PRHISM protocol [30]. \nA summary of the PRHISM assessment principles is \nincluded in Table\u00a02.\nTo determine accuracy, the information contained in \nthe Instagram posts was evaluated against information \ncontained in the Australian Dietary Guidelines (ADG) \n[44] Nutrient Reference Values (NRVs), Practice-based \nEvidence in Nutrition Global Resource for Nutrition \nPractice (PEN), [45] and/or Metafact fact-checking plat-\nform. [46] Metafact is a website that enables the public \nto ask questions, which are answered by verified PhDs, \nresearchers and medical specialists.[46] Multiple experts \ncan answer the questions and if\u2009\u2265\u200970% of verified experts \nagree on an answer, it is deemed that consensus has \nbeen achieved [46]. Only questions with consensus were \nused for accuracy evaluations. A large number of posts \nwithin the sample contained claims about the benefits of \ncollagen supplementation for skin health, however, rel-\nevant information was not contained within the chosen \nauthoritative resources. Therefore, a recent systematic \nreview about collagen supplementation was also used to \ndetermine the accuracy of claims about collagen and skin \nhealth [47]. An accuracy coding framework was devel-\noped and was informed by a systematic review of the \nquality and accuracy of online nutrition information [25]. \nPosts were coded as containing information that is com-\npletely inaccurate (0), mostly inaccurate with some accu-\nracies (1), mostly accurate with some inaccuracies (2), \ncompletely accurate (3) or not assessable (4) (see Table\u20092 \nfor descriptions of accuracy categories). All the nutrition \ninformation within a post was considered when evaluat-\ning accuracy. If posts contained information about nutri-\ntion and other topics, such as sleep or exercise, only the \ninformation about nutrition was evaluated. Some posts \ncontained claims about the health benefits of specific \nPage 5 of 14\nDenniss\u00a0et\u00a0al.

In \nthese instances, additional information about the prod-\nuct was sourced from its website in order to evaluate the \naccuracy of the claims.\nAssessments were conducted and recorded in a pur-\npose-designed REDCap database. A set of coding rules \nwas developed to ensure that information that appeared \nmultiple times in the sample of posts was coded consist-\nently for accuracy. Before completing the quality and \naccuracy evaluations, a random 10% if the sample was \nevaluated independently by two authors (ED and LM) for \ninter-rater reliability, achieving 79% agreement for quality \ncategory and 85% for accuracy score. Disagreements \nregarding quality or accuracy evaluations were discussed \nby ED and LM until consensus was reached. Common \nreasons for disagreement were discussed and relevant \nupdates to the study protocol were made before the \nremaining evaluations were completed to improve rigor. \nED conducted the quality and accuracy assessments for \nthe remainder of the sample to further improve consist-\nency. Posts containing information that was difficult to \nevaluate were discussed before reaching a decision. Ins-\ntagram accounts and the topic of Instagram posts were \ninductively categorised. The categories for Instagram \naccounts were developed by the two researchers (ED and \nJV) who undertook the screening of Instagram accounts, \nTable\u202f2\u2002 Summary of quality principles assessed by the PRHISM tool and accuracy score categories\nAbbreviations: PRHISM: Principles for Health-related Information on Social Media\na From: Denniss et\u00a0al.

Int J Behav Nutr Phys Act           (2024) 21:16 \nafter screening had concluded and both researchers were \nimmersed in the data. Each included account was inde-\npendently categorised, and disagreements were discussed \nby ED and JV until agreement was reached. The catego-\nries for Instagram accounts were used in the preceding \nstudy for which the data was originally collected [7]. \nCategories for post topic were developed during the reli-\nability assessments based on the most frequent nutrition-\nrelated topics mentioned in the posts and all posts were \ncategorised by the first author. Descriptions of account \nand topic categories are summarised in Supplementary \nTable\u00a02.\nStatistical analysis\nData was exported from REDCap and statistical analyses \nwere performed in Stata/SE v17.0 (StataCorp, College \nStation, TX). Descriptive statistics were run. Multilevel \nmixed-effects models were used to estimate quality \nscores for account categories, post topics, account veri-\nfication, accuracy score, follower count, engagement, \nand engagement rate. Marginal means of quality scores \nfor account categories and post topics were calculated. \nPairwise comparisons were run to determine mean dif-\nferences in quality scores across account categories, post \ntopics and accuracy categories. Mixed-effects ordered \nlogistic regression models were used to estimate accu-\nracy score outcomes for account categories, post top-\nics, account verification, follower count, engagement \nand engagement rate. Pairwise comparisons were run \nto determine mean differences in quality scores across \naccount categories and post topics. Mixed-effects models \nwere chosen to account for the structure of the data, with \nthe possibility of repeat measures (i.e., multiple posts) \nfor each Instagram account, with posts being the unit \nof analysis and the models including random intercepts \nfor Instagram accounts. Quality and accuracy scores \nwere treated as the dependent variable. Engagement and \nengagement rate had positively skewed distributions and \nwere log transformed. One account had an outlying num-\nber of followers (>\u20092,000,000) and was thus removed from \nanalyses involving follower counts. After removing the \noutlying account, follower counts remained skewed and \nwere also log transformed to achieve normal distribution. \nAnalysis was run with and without the outlying account \nshowing little difference to the result (data not shown). \nStatistical significance was set at P\u2009<\u20090.05.\nEthics\nThe Instagram posts included in this study were pub-\nlicly available. Due to the public nature of the data, this \nstudy was exempt from formal review by an ethics com-\nmittee. To ensure that this study upholds ethical research \nstandards, no identifying information about the account-\nholders has been published.\nResults\nA total of 676 posts from 47 accounts were included in \nthe final sample (Fig.\u00a01, Table\u00a03). Accounts had an aver-\nage of 314,817 followers. The most common topic dis-\ncussed in posts was supplements (36.4%) followed by \nfoods/nutrients and health (17.2%), general healthy eat-\ning (16.0%), weight loss (13.5%), sports/exercise nutrition \n(6.7%), other (5.5%) and paediatric nutrition (4.9%).\nQuality\nOverall, 34.8% (n\u2009=\u2009235) of posts were classified as poor, \n59.2% (n\u2009=\u2009400) mediocre, 6.1% (n\u2009=\u200941) good and zero \nposts were classified as excellent quality. The mean \nPRHISM score was mediocre (31.8\u2009\u00b1\u200910.3 out of a pos-\nsible score of 100) and scores varied across principles \n(Table\u00a0 4). Only two principles had a mean score above \ntwo (4. Financial disclosure and 13. Images) (Table\u00a0 5). \nPosts authored by accounts in the nutritionist/dietitian \ninfluencer account category were associated with higher \nquality scores compared to the reference group (brands) \n(\u03b2, 17.8, CI 13.94\u201321.65; P\u2009<\u20090.001) and all other account \ncategories. Posts that contained information about foods/\nnutrients and health or general healthy eating were \nassociated with higher quality scores compared to the \nreference group (weight loss information) and posts con-\ntaining information about supplements. There was no \nassociation between information quality and accounts \nbeing verified (\u03b2 0.572, P\u2009=\u20090.821) or follower count (\u03b2 \n-1.18, P\u2009=\u20090.643). Lower quality scores were associated \nwith higher engagement (\u03b2 -0.59, P\u2009=\u20090.012) and higher \nengagement rate (\u03b2 -0.57, P\u2009=\u20090.016), although these dif-\nferences were small. A complete summary of the results \nfrom the mixed effects analysis of quality scores by \naccount type and post topic is provided in Supplemen-\ntary Table\u00a03 and 4.\nAccuracy\nFrom the 676 posts included in the sample, 166 were not \nassessable and a total of 510 posts were evaluated for \naccuracy (see Fig.\u00a0 1). Of the posts that were evaluated \nfor accuracy, 44.7% (n\u2009=\u2009228) of posts contained inac-\ncuracies, 8.6% (n\u2009=\u200944) of posts were completely inac-\ncurate, 14.3% (n\u2009=\u200973) mostly inaccurate, 21.8% (111) \nmostly accurate and 55.3% (n\u2009=\u2009282) completely accurate. \nPosts published by fitness influencers had higher odds of \nreceiving a higher score for accuracy compared to posts \npublished by brands (OR 3.09, CI 1.21\u20137.87, P\u2009=\u20090.018) \nas did posts published by nutritionist/dietitian influencer \naccounts (OR 4.69, CI 1.81\u201312.14, P\u2009=\u20090.001). In terms of \ntopics, posts containing information about supplements \nPage 7 of 14\nDenniss\u00a0et\u00a0al. Int J Behav Nutr Phys Act           (2024) 21:16 \n\t\nhad lower odds of receiving a higher accuracy score com-\npared to posts containing information about weight loss \n(OR 0.23, CI 0.10\u20130.51, P\u2009=\u20090.00), sports/exercise nutri-\ntion, foods/nutrients and health, and general healthy \neating. There was no difference in odds of receiving a \nhigher accuracy score for posts authored by a verified or \nnon-verified account (OR 2.07, CI 0.87\u20134.94, P\u2009=\u20090.10), \nfollower count (OR 1.12, CI 0.46\u20132.69, P\u2009=\u20090.803), \nengagement (OR 1.02, CI 0.84\u20131.24, P\u2009=\u20090.831) or engage-\nment rate (OR 1.0, CI 0.82\u20131.21, P\u2009=\u20090.960). A complete \nsummary of the results from the mixed effects analysis \nof accuracy scores by account type and post topic is pro-\nvided in Supplementary Table\u00a03 and 4.\nPosts that were completely accurate were associated \nwith higher quality scores compared to posts that were \ncompletely inaccurate (\u03b2 2.24, CI 0.29\u20134.19, P\u2009=\u20090.024). \nHowever, the differences in quality scores between posts \ncontaining completely accurate versus completely inac-\ncurate information was small. There was no difference in \nquality scores observed for posts containing mostly inac-\ncurate or mostly accurate information.\nDiscussion\nThis content analysis study evaluated the quality and \naccuracy of nutrition-related information posted by \npopular Australian Instagram accounts. Results indicate \nFig.\u202f1\u2002 Flow chart of\u00a0sample selection process\nPage 8 of 14\nDenniss\u00a0et\u00a0al. Int J Behav Nutr Phys Act           (2024) 21:16 \nthat most information posted by Australian accounts is of \nlow to moderate quality and almost half of posts contain \ninaccuracies. Information about supplements or posted \nby brand accounts tended to be of lower quality and \naccuracy compared to other topics and authors of infor-\nmation. Australian nutritionist and dietitian accounts \nposted higher quality information that was more likely to \nbe accurate.\nOverall, the quality and accuracy of nutrition-related \nInstagram posts included in this study was poor and \nposts that were of lower quality received higher engage-\nment. These findings are consistent with content analyses \nof nutrition-related information from YouTube, [48\u201351] \nInstagram, [36] WhatsApp, [52] Twitter, [53] Facebook, \n[54] and blogs, [55] which found large proportions of \ninaccurate and poor quality information. Furthermore, a \nstudy on YouTube videos about nutrition following bari-\natric surgery found that poor quality and inaccurate vid-\neos were the most popular [50]. Conversely, studies about \nhealthy eating information on blogs [56] and information \nabout food safety and eating for coeliac disease on You-\nTube [57, 58] have found information to be accurate and \nof fair to high quality. More broadly, studies about health-\nrelated information on social media have found that \nhealth misinformation is abundant on social media plat-\nforms and is often more popular than factual information \n[31]. A small association between information accuracy \nand quality was observed, which is consistent with previ-\nous research that has seen a very weak correlation [59] \nor no correlation [60] between the quality and accuracy \nof nutrition-related information. Findings from this study \nand the health and nutrition communication literature \nsuggest that Instagram and other social media users are \nlikely to be exposed to suboptimal and misleading nutri-\ntion information. Furthermore, over a third of posts in \nthis study contained a combination of accurate and inac-\ncurate information, which may make it difficult for con-\nsumers to identify accurate information when engaging \nwith nutrition-related posts by Australian accounts. The \ngenerally low PRHISM scores that Australian accounts \nreceived suggest that consumers may be presented with \ninformation that is difficult to understand and lacks suf-\nficient context or evidence, which may undermine public \nhealth nutrition efforts and contribute to confusion and \nbacklash [34, 35].\nInformation about supplements and information \nposted by brand accounts was of the lowest quality and \naccuracy consistent with existing research. A systematic \nreview of the quality and accuracy of online nutrition \ninformation found that information published by com-\nmercial entities was often of the lowest quality and accu-\nracy, however, this finding was not consistent throughout \nthe included studies and there was variation in which \npublishers provided the most reliable information [25]. \nThe same review also found that information about sup-\nplements was typically inaccurate and of low quality [25]. \nSimilarly, Basch et\u00a0al. found that YouTube videos about \nmultivitamin supplements were of poor quality, [49] and \na small analysis of Instagram posts containing #immune-\nbooster found numerous inaccurate claims about the \nimmune boosting benefits of supplements during the \nCOVID-19 pandemic [61]. Marketing from brands and \ninfluencers dominates social media and the marketing of \nsupplements is prevalent on Instagram [4, 7].

Int J Behav Nutr Phys Act           (2024) 21:16 \nIntroduction\nPoor diet quality is the leading preventable risk factor \ncontributing to the global burden of non-communica-\nble disease [1]. Dietary behaviours are complex and are \ninfluenced by a range of factors, including hunger, taste \npreferences, food availability, price, societal norms, and \npolicy context [2]. Nutrition information environments, \nwhich encompass the media and advertising, can also \nexert an influence on dietary behaviours [2]. Social media \nhas recently become a prominent part of the modern \nmedia environment and is a popular vehicle for advertis-\ning, marketing and information sharing. Fifty-nine per-\ncent of the global population are active on social media, \n[3] and social media advertising revenue was projected to \nreach $173 billion USD in 2022 [4]. Food and nutrition \nare popular topics on social media platforms, [5, 6] and \nmarketing of food and supplement products has become \nprolific [7, 8]. There is a growing body of evidence that \nindicates food and nutrition content and marketing \non social media has the power to influence food choice \n[9\u201312].\nAs the Internet has become more accessible, individu-\nals have increasingly utilised it to source information \nabout nutrition. Consumers seek nutrition information \nfor various reasons including health management, curi-\nosity, and interest\u00a0 [13]. Nutrition information is con-\ntent that provides the general public with guidance on \nsourcing, storing, preparing and consuming food to sup-\nport good health, and includes recipes, product details, \nhealthy-eating advice and nutritional requirements \n(defined in full in Table\u00a01). Increases in online nutrition \ninformation seeking behaviour have been observed in \nAmerica, [14] Canada, [15] France, [16] and Norway, [17] \nand the Internet is the primary source of nutrition infor-\nmation for Australians [18, 19]. Social media has become \na ubiquitous part of the Internet and consumers search \nfor and follow food and nutrition-related content on \nsocial media [6, 20\u201322]. A survey of American Instagram \nusers found that 87% of female users followed nutrition-\nrelated content on the platform [6]. Consumers not only \nseek information about food and nutrition on social \nmedia they are also passively exposed to it in their social \nmedia feeds without intentionally searching for it [23, \n24]. Due to the influence of social media algorithms and \npaid sponsorships, social media users are also presented \nwith content in their feed from entities that they do not \nfollow. Furthermore, content can be published by anyone, \nregardless of their qualifications, level of expertise in the \ntopic or conflicting interests.\nAccurate and high-quality information is essential \nfor effective health communication and promotion. In \nhealth communication literature, accuracy refers to \nhealth information\u2019s factual correctness, and quality \nrefers to information\u2019s reliability when assessed using \ndefined quality criteria (see Table\u00a0 1) [25, 26]. Quality \nand accuracy are two important but distinct compo-\nnents of information\u2019s overall reliability. It is possible \nfor information to be accurate but of low quality and \nvice versa. Previous studies have assessed the accu-\nracy of online nutrition information against authorita-\ntive sources such as dietary guidelines, authoritative \nreports and peer reviewed literature [25]. Numerous \nquality assessment tools have been used to evaluate \nthe quality of online nutrition information, such as the \nDISCERN Instrument, [27]. Journal of the American \nMedical Association Benchmarks, [28] and Health on \nthe Net Code Principles [7, 29]. These tools share com-\nmon quality criteria, such as, declaring financial inter-\nests, citing sources, authorship by an individual with \nrelevant health-related qualifications, and disclosure of \nthe author\u2019s qualifications. Principles for Health-related \nInformation on Social Media (PRHISM), is a recently \ndeveloped quality assessment tool, which includes \nthese established quality principles and additional \nprinciples that are relevant to social media, including \naccessibility and readability [30]. There is a broad con-\nsensus in the literature that health information of sub-\noptimal quality and accuracy is extremely prevalent on \nsocial media [26, 31]. Concerningly, misinformation is \noften more popular than truthful information, receives \nhigher user engagement and spreads more quickly than \nthe truth due to its novelty [31, 32]. Furthermore, the \nnarrative of health misinformation often includes and \npromotes mistrust in authoritative institutions and \nTable\u202f1\u2002 Key definitions\na From Denniss et\u00a0al. [25]\nAccuracy: The factual correctness of\u00a0information when\u00a0compared to\u00a0authoritative sources of\u00a0information such as\u00a0systematic reviews, meta analyses \nor\u00a0national dietary guidelines [25].\nQuality: The reliability of\u00a0information as\u00a0assessed by\u00a0quality criteria [26]. Quality criteria typically include components such as\u00a0readability, inclusion of\u00a0ref-\nerences, transparency about\u00a0financial interests and\u00a0disclosure of\u00a0the\u00a0author\u2019s identity and\u00a0qualifications\naNutrition-related information: information regarding\u00a0healthy eating, dietary patterns, nutrients, nutritional requirements, nutritional composition \nof\u00a0foods, nutritional supplements, health outcomes associated with\u00a0foods and\u00a0dietary patterns, food safety, food ethics, cooking and\u00a0recipes intended \nfor\u00a0the\u00a0general public [25].\nPage 3 of 14\nDenniss\u00a0et\u00a0al. Int J Behav Nutr Phys Act           (2024) 21:16 \n\t\nexperts [31]. Social media-based misinformation can \nhave consequences for public health, for example, the \nonline anti-vaccination movement is believed to have \ncontributed to a reduction in vaccination rates and the \nreemergence of previously eradicated communicable \ndiseases [31, 33].\nPublic health nutrition experts and organisations have \nraised concerns about the potential for nutrition-related \nmisinformation to cause serious harm and undermine \ncredible nutrition communication. Exposure to nutri-\ntion information that lacks context or contradicts previ-\nous messaging can lead to confusion and backlash, which \nhas been evidenced to reduce consumers\u2019 willingness \nto engage in healthful behaviours and accept advice by \nauthoritative nutrition experts [34, 35]. If dietary behav-\niours are based on misinformation that contradicts evi-\ndence-based dietary guidelines, it may put individuals at \ngreater risk of developing non-communicable diseases \nthat are associated with unhealthy dietary patterns [1]. A \nrecent systematic review of studies evaluating the quality \nand accuracy of nutrition-related information published \non websites and social media found that generally infor-\nmation was of suboptimal quality and accuracy [25]. A \nsmall number of studies in the review investigated cer-\ntain social media (e.g., blogs, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter \nand WhatsApp), meaning other platforms, such as Insta-\ngram have had limited attention [25]. A further limitation \nwas that quality assessment tools designed for different \nsettings, for example, websites, were used to evaluate the \nsocial media content [25]. Furthermore, it was also rare \nfor studies to involve multiple researchers when screen-\ning posts to evaluate, which is a potential source of bias \n[25]. One recent study that was not captured within the \ndate-range of the systematic review examined the qual-\nity of nutrition-related information on Instagram find-\ning that quality was extremely low [36]. However, this \nstudy measured quality as a single criterion, rather than \nusing an extensive quality assessment method, and thus \nmay not have comprehensively measured the quality of \ninformation.\nTo the knowledge of the authors, thus far no studies \nhave assessed the accuracy of nutrition information on \nInstagram, and none have used social media specific tools \nto evaluate the quality of nutrition-related Instagram \ncontent. Instagram was the third most popular social \nmedia platform in Australia, and the fifth most visited \nwebsite in the world in 2021, [3,\u00a037] and nutrition is one \nof the most frequently discussed health topics on Insta-\ngram [5]. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evalu-\nate the quality and accuracy of nutrition information \nposted by popular Australian Instagram accounts using \nthe PRHISM tool to assess quality. A secondary aim was \nto examine trends in information quality and accuracy by \nauthor, topic, post engagement, account verification and \nnumber of followers.\nMethods\nStudy design and\u00a0data collection\nThe present study involved a cross-sectional evaluation \nof the quality and accuracy of nutrition-related infor-\nmation published on Instagram by Australian influencer \nor brand accounts. The Strengthening the Reporting of \nObservational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guide-\nlines were followed and the checklist is available in Sup-\nplementary Table\u00a01 [38]. A subsample of Instagram posts \ncollected for a wider project formed the dataset for this \nstudy and data collection has been described in detail \nelsewhere [7]. Briefly, a list of the top 1,000 Australian \nhealth Instagram accounts as of April 2021 was screened \nto determine eligibility [39]. Australian accounts with \nover 100,000 followers, a minimum of 100 posts, their \nmost recent post published within two weeks, and a \nminimum of 25% of their content relating to nutrition \nwere included. The figure of 100,000 followers was cho-\nsen because accounts with over 100,000 followers are \nconsidered to be macro influencers or above (over one \nmillion followers is considered to be a mega influencer) \n[40]. Social media users tend to trust the influencers and \nbrands that they follow, [41] and the purpose of this study \nwas to capture information posted by popular Austral-\nian Instagram accounts, therefore, only accounts with \ngreater than 100,000 followers were considered eligible \nfor inclusion. Accounts appearing under the \u201csuggested\u201d \ntab on the Instagram page of included accounts were \nalso screened. Screening was done between May and July \n2021 using an Instagram account made specifically for \nthe project and using Google Chrome\u2019s incognito mode \nto minimise the impact of the algorithm on the sug-\ngested accounts. Two researchers (ED and JV, named in \nacknowledgements) independently screened all accounts \nand disagreements were discussed until agreement was \nreached.\nAll posts by eligible accounts from a twelve-month \nperiod (September 2020 \u2013 September 2021) were down-\nloaded through a paid subscription to Keyhole, an online \nsocial media analytics tool. The data extracted through \nKeyhole included each post\u2019s text-based caption, engage-\nment (sum of likes and comments), the date of upload \nand each account\u2019s bio, number of followers and if it \nwas verified with a blue tick. Each post was manually \nscreened for relevance. Video content including Reels \nand posts that did not refer to one or more component \nof nutrition-related information, as defined in Table\u00a0 1, \nwere excluded. Ten percent of posts were screened inde-\npendently by the lead author (ED) and a research assis-\ntant (JV) for relevance to nutrition information, with 94% \nPage 4 of 14\nDenniss\u00a0et\u00a0al. Int J Behav Nutr Phys Act           (2024) 21:16 \nagreement. The screening resulted in a sample of 10,964 \nInstagram posts containing nutrition-related informa-\ntion, which have been characterised in a previous content \nanalysis study [7].\nFor this study, a random stratified (by Instagram \naccount) subsample of the 10,964 posts were selected and \nscreened further for eligibility. A total of 2,025 posts were \nrandomly selected to be screened (up to 35 posts from \neach of the included Instagram accounts). The random \nsubsample for screening was selected using the sample \nfunction in Stata in March 2022. Posts that promoted a \nproduct but did not include any information about the \nhealth benefits of the product, for example, promotion of \na supplement without mention of its benefits, and posts \nthat only included recipes or meal ideas and no additional \ninformation were excluded because these posts did not \nprovide nutrition guidance that could be evaluated for \naccuracy or quality. All other posts were deemed eligible. \nScreening was done independently by two researchers \n(all posts screened by ED and with secondary screening \nby SM, LM or research assistant JL). Disagreements were \ndiscussed by the two researchers responsible for screen-\ning the relevant post until consensus was reached.\nQuality and\u00a0accuracy evaluations\nThe quality of information was evaluated using the \nPRHISM tool [30]. PRHISM was developed as a tool to \nevaluate the quality of social media-based information \nabout any health-related topic and considers the unique \ncharacteristics of social media content, for example, \ncovert advertising and brevity of information. To the \nknowledge of the authors, PRHISM is the only qual-\nity assessment tool that has been specifically developed \nfor health information delivered via social media. Other \ntools for evaluating the quality of health-related informa-\ntion exist. However, these tools were developed for dif-\nferent settings, such as websites or patient information \npamphlets and their use to evaluate health-related social \nmedia content has been scrutinised in the literature [25, \n42, 43]. PRHISM was developed in a Delphi study, which \ninvolved a panel of 18 expert participants [30]. The par-\nticipants were experts in health communication or a \nhealth-related field, used social media to communicate \nabout health and worked in academia, public health, \ncommunications and/or as health professionals. Three \nDelphi surveys were undertaken to determine group con-\nsensus about the principles to include in PRHISM. Prin-\nciples were based on quality criteria from previous tools \nand adapted to suit social media or were new principles \nsuggested by the expert panel. After the third Delphi sur-\nvey, a draft of the PRHISM scoring tool and guide for use \nwas circulated to participants for feedback about face \nvalidity and participants agreed with the final wording of \nthe principles and guide [30].\nPRHISM consists of thirteen principles that are scored \nfrom zero to four [30]. A number of principles may not \nbe relevant to evaluate depending on the nature of the \nsocial media post being evaluated, for example, principle \n8 relates to privacy and is only relevant to evaluate if the \npost discusses a client or patient. The overall PRHISM \nscore is weighted proportionately as a percentage of the \ntotal available score, whereby principles that are deemed \nnot relevant do not contribute to the total available score. \nThe overall PRHISM score ranges from 0 \u2013 100 where a \nhigher score indicates higher quality. A score of zero to \n25 is considered poor, 26\u2013 50 mediocre, 51 \u2013 75 good \nand 76 \u2013 100 excellent quality [30]. All images and infor-\nmation contained within the post, information in the \naccount holder\u2019s bio and information contained in links \nprovided within the post or bio were considered in qual-\nity evaluations, as outlined in the PRHISM protocol [30]. \nA summary of the PRHISM assessment principles is \nincluded in Table\u00a02.\nTo determine accuracy, the information contained in \nthe Instagram posts was evaluated against information \ncontained in the Australian Dietary Guidelines (ADG) \n[44] Nutrient Reference Values (NRVs), Practice-based \nEvidence in Nutrition Global Resource for Nutrition \nPractice (PEN), [45] and/or Metafact fact-checking plat-\nform. [46] Metafact is a website that enables the public \nto ask questions, which are answered by verified PhDs, \nresearchers and medical specialists.[46] Multiple experts \ncan answer the questions and if\u2009\u2265\u200970% of verified experts \nagree on an answer, it is deemed that consensus has \nbeen achieved [46]. Only questions with consensus were \nused for accuracy evaluations. A large number of posts \nwithin the sample contained claims about the benefits of \ncollagen supplementation for skin health, however, rel-\nevant information was not contained within the chosen \nauthoritative resources. Therefore, a recent systematic \nreview about collagen supplementation was also used to \ndetermine the accuracy of claims about collagen and skin \nhealth [47]. An accuracy coding framework was devel-\noped and was informed by a systematic review of the \nquality and accuracy of online nutrition information [25]. \nPosts were coded as containing information that is com-\npletely inaccurate (0), mostly inaccurate with some accu-\nracies (1), mostly accurate with some inaccuracies (2), \ncompletely accurate (3) or not assessable (4) (see Table\u20092 \nfor descriptions of accuracy categories). All the nutrition \ninformation within a post was considered when evaluat-\ning accuracy. If posts contained information about nutri-\ntion and other topics, such as sleep or exercise, only the \ninformation about nutrition was evaluated. Some posts \ncontained claims about the health benefits of specific \nPage 5 of 14\nDenniss\u00a0et\u00a0al.

In \nthese instances, additional information about the prod-\nuct was sourced from its website in order to evaluate the \naccuracy of the claims.\nAssessments were conducted and recorded in a pur-\npose-designed REDCap database. A set of coding rules \nwas developed to ensure that information that appeared \nmultiple times in the sample of posts was coded consist-\nently for accuracy. Before completing the quality and \naccuracy evaluations, a random 10% if the sample was \nevaluated independently by two authors (ED and LM) for \ninter-rater reliability, achieving 79% agreement for quality \ncategory and 85% for accuracy score. Disagreements \nregarding quality or accuracy evaluations were discussed \nby ED and LM until consensus was reached. Common \nreasons for disagreement were discussed and relevant \nupdates to the study protocol were made before the \nremaining evaluations were completed to improve rigor. \nED conducted the quality and accuracy assessments for \nthe remainder of the sample to further improve consist-\nency. Posts containing information that was difficult to \nevaluate were discussed before reaching a decision. Ins-\ntagram accounts and the topic of Instagram posts were \ninductively categorised. The categories for Instagram \naccounts were developed by the two researchers (ED and \nJV) who undertook the screening of Instagram accounts, \nTable\u202f2\u2002 Summary of quality principles assessed by the PRHISM tool and accuracy score categories\nAbbreviations: PRHISM: Principles for Health-related Information on Social Media\na From: Denniss et\u00a0al.

Int J Behav Nutr Phys Act           (2024) 21:16 \nafter screening had concluded and both researchers were \nimmersed in the data. Each included account was inde-\npendently categorised, and disagreements were discussed \nby ED and JV until agreement was reached. The catego-\nries for Instagram accounts were used in the preceding \nstudy for which the data was originally collected [7]. \nCategories for post topic were developed during the reli-\nability assessments based on the most frequent nutrition-\nrelated topics mentioned in the posts and all posts were \ncategorised by the first author. Descriptions of account \nand topic categories are summarised in Supplementary \nTable\u00a02.\nStatistical analysis\nData was exported from REDCap and statistical analyses \nwere performed in Stata/SE v17.0 (StataCorp, College \nStation, TX). Descriptive statistics were run. Multilevel \nmixed-effects models were used to estimate quality \nscores for account categories, post topics, account veri-\nfication, accuracy score, follower count, engagement, \nand engagement rate. Marginal means of quality scores \nfor account categories and post topics were calculated. \nPairwise comparisons were run to determine mean dif-\nferences in quality scores across account categories, post \ntopics and accuracy categories. Mixed-effects ordered \nlogistic regression models were used to estimate accu-\nracy score outcomes for account categories, post top-\nics, account verification, follower count, engagement \nand engagement rate. Pairwise comparisons were run \nto determine mean differences in quality scores across \naccount categories and post topics. Mixed-effects models \nwere chosen to account for the structure of the data, with \nthe possibility of repeat measures (i.e., multiple posts) \nfor each Instagram account, with posts being the unit \nof analysis and the models including random intercepts \nfor Instagram accounts. Quality and accuracy scores \nwere treated as the dependent variable. Engagement and \nengagement rate had positively skewed distributions and \nwere log transformed. One account had an outlying num-\nber of followers (>\u20092,000,000) and was thus removed from \nanalyses involving follower counts. After removing the \noutlying account, follower counts remained skewed and \nwere also log transformed to achieve normal distribution. \nAnalysis was run with and without the outlying account \nshowing little difference to the result (data not shown). \nStatistical significance was set at P\u2009<\u20090.05.\nEthics\nThe Instagram posts included in this study were pub-\nlicly available. Due to the public nature of the data, this \nstudy was exempt from formal review by an ethics com-\nmittee. To ensure that this study upholds ethical research \nstandards, no identifying information about the account-\nholders has been published.\nResults\nA total of 676 posts from 47 accounts were included in \nthe final sample (Fig.\u00a01, Table\u00a03). Accounts had an aver-\nage of 314,817 followers. The most common topic dis-\ncussed in posts was supplements (36.4%) followed by \nfoods/nutrients and health (17.2%), general healthy eat-\ning (16.0%), weight loss (13.5%), sports/exercise nutrition \n(6.7%), other (5.5%) and paediatric nutrition (4.9%).\nQuality\nOverall, 34.8% (n\u2009=\u2009235) of posts were classified as poor, \n59.2% (n\u2009=\u2009400) mediocre, 6.1% (n\u2009=\u200941) good and zero \nposts were classified as excellent quality. The mean \nPRHISM score was mediocre (31.8\u2009\u00b1\u200910.3 out of a pos-\nsible score of 100) and scores varied across principles \n(Table\u00a0 4). Only two principles had a mean score above \ntwo (4. Financial disclosure and 13. Images) (Table\u00a0 5). \nPosts authored by accounts in the nutritionist/dietitian \ninfluencer account category were associated with higher \nquality scores compared to the reference group (brands) \n(\u03b2, 17.8, CI 13.94\u201321.65; P\u2009<\u20090.001) and all other account \ncategories. Posts that contained information about foods/\nnutrients and health or general healthy eating were \nassociated with higher quality scores compared to the \nreference group (weight loss information) and posts con-\ntaining information about supplements. There was no \nassociation between information quality and accounts \nbeing verified (\u03b2 0.572, P\u2009=\u20090.821) or follower count (\u03b2 \n-1.18, P\u2009=\u20090.643). Lower quality scores were associated \nwith higher engagement (\u03b2 -0.59, P\u2009=\u20090.012) and higher \nengagement rate (\u03b2 -0.57, P\u2009=\u20090.016), although these dif-\nferences were small. A complete summary of the results \nfrom the mixed effects analysis of quality scores by \naccount type and post topic is provided in Supplemen-\ntary Table\u00a03 and 4.\nAccuracy\nFrom the 676 posts included in the sample, 166 were not \nassessable and a total of 510 posts were evaluated for \naccuracy (see Fig.\u00a0 1). Of the posts that were evaluated \nfor accuracy, 44.7% (n\u2009=\u2009228) of posts contained inac-\ncuracies, 8.6% (n\u2009=\u200944) of posts were completely inac-\ncurate, 14.3% (n\u2009=\u200973) mostly inaccurate, 21.8% (111) \nmostly accurate and 55.3% (n\u2009=\u2009282) completely accurate. \nPosts published by fitness influencers had higher odds of \nreceiving a higher score for accuracy compared to posts \npublished by brands (OR 3.09, CI 1.21\u20137.87, P\u2009=\u20090.018) \nas did posts published by nutritionist/dietitian influencer \naccounts (OR 4.69, CI 1.81\u201312.14, P\u2009=\u20090.001). In terms of \ntopics, posts containing information about supplements \nPage 7 of 14\nDenniss\u00a0et\u00a0al. Int J Behav Nutr Phys Act           (2024) 21:16 \n\t\nhad lower odds of receiving a higher accuracy score com-\npared to posts containing information about weight loss \n(OR 0.23, CI 0.10\u20130.51, P\u2009=\u20090.00), sports/exercise nutri-\ntion, foods/nutrients and health, and general healthy \neating. There was no difference in odds of receiving a \nhigher accuracy score for posts authored by a verified or \nnon-verified account (OR 2.07, CI 0.87\u20134.94, P\u2009=\u20090.10), \nfollower count (OR 1.12, CI 0.46\u20132.69, P\u2009=\u20090.803), \nengagement (OR 1.02, CI 0.84\u20131.24, P\u2009=\u20090.831) or engage-\nment rate (OR 1.0, CI 0.82\u20131.21, P\u2009=\u20090.960). A complete \nsummary of the results from the mixed effects analysis \nof accuracy scores by account type and post topic is pro-\nvided in Supplementary Table\u00a03 and 4.\nPosts that were completely accurate were associated \nwith higher quality scores compared to posts that were \ncompletely inaccurate (\u03b2 2.24, CI 0.29\u20134.19, P\u2009=\u20090.024). \nHowever, the differences in quality scores between posts \ncontaining completely accurate versus completely inac-\ncurate information was small. There was no difference in \nquality scores observed for posts containing mostly inac-\ncurate or mostly accurate information.\nDiscussion\nThis content analysis study evaluated the quality and \naccuracy of nutrition-related information posted by \npopular Australian Instagram accounts. Results indicate \nFig.\u202f1\u2002 Flow chart of\u00a0sample selection process\nPage 8 of 14\nDenniss\u00a0et\u00a0al. Int J Behav Nutr Phys Act           (2024) 21:16 \nthat most information posted by Australian accounts is of \nlow to moderate quality and almost half of posts contain \ninaccuracies. Information about supplements or posted \nby brand accounts tended to be of lower quality and \naccuracy compared to other topics and authors of infor-\nmation. Australian nutritionist and dietitian accounts \nposted higher quality information that was more likely to \nbe accurate.\nOverall, the quality and accuracy of nutrition-related \nInstagram posts included in this study was poor and \nposts that were of lower quality received higher engage-\nment. These findings are consistent with content analyses \nof nutrition-related information from YouTube, [48\u201351] \nInstagram, [36] WhatsApp, [52] Twitter, [53] Facebook, \n[54] and blogs, [55] which found large proportions of \ninaccurate and poor quality information. Furthermore, a \nstudy on YouTube videos about nutrition following bari-\natric surgery found that poor quality and inaccurate vid-\neos were the most popular [50]. Conversely, studies about \nhealthy eating information on blogs [56] and information \nabout food safety and eating for coeliac disease on You-\nTube [57, 58] have found information to be accurate and \nof fair to high quality. More broadly, studies about health-\nrelated information on social media have found that \nhealth misinformation is abundant on social media plat-\nforms and is often more popular than factual information \n[31]. A small association between information accuracy \nand quality was observed, which is consistent with previ-\nous research that has seen a very weak correlation [59] \nor no correlation [60] between the quality and accuracy \nof nutrition-related information. Findings from this study \nand the health and nutrition communication literature \nsuggest that Instagram and other social media users are \nlikely to be exposed to suboptimal and misleading nutri-\ntion information. Furthermore, over a third of posts in \nthis study contained a combination of accurate and inac-\ncurate information, which may make it difficult for con-\nsumers to identify accurate information when engaging \nwith nutrition-related posts by Australian accounts. The \ngenerally low PRHISM scores that Australian accounts \nreceived suggest that consumers may be presented with \ninformation that is difficult to understand and lacks suf-\nficient context or evidence, which may undermine public \nhealth nutrition efforts and contribute to confusion and \nbacklash [34, 35].\nInformation about supplements and information \nposted by brand accounts was of the lowest quality and \naccuracy consistent with existing research. A systematic \nreview of the quality and accuracy of online nutrition \ninformation found that information published by com-\nmercial entities was often of the lowest quality and accu-\nracy, however, this finding was not consistent throughout \nthe included studies and there was variation in which \npublishers provided the most reliable information [25]. \nThe same review also found that information about sup-\nplements was typically inaccurate and of low quality [25]. \nSimilarly, Basch et\u00a0al. found that YouTube videos about \nmultivitamin supplements were of poor quality, [49] and \na small analysis of Instagram posts containing #immune-\nbooster found numerous inaccurate claims about the \nimmune boosting benefits of supplements during the \nCOVID-19 pandemic [61]. Marketing from brands and \ninfluencers dominates social media and the marketing of \nsupplements is prevalent on Instagram [4, 7].

In 2022, \nan Australian supplement company with a large social \nmedia presence was fined $26,640 AUD by the Therapeu-\ntic Goods Administration for unlawful claims about their \nsupplements and cancer and Alzheimer\u2019s prevention [62]. \nMore frequent and severe prosecution for misleading \ninformation may help disincentivise commercial entities \nfrom making false claims.\nIn this study posts by Australian nutritionists and \ndietitians generally received higher quality and accuracy \nscores than posts by other accounts. This is consistent \nwith results from a recent analysis of nutrition-related \nInstagram content, where posts categorised as \u201cnutrition \nand dietetics\u201d received higher quality evaluations com-\npared to other categories such as \u201cfitness\u201d and \u201cmotiva-\ntion\u201d [36]. Furthermore, previous accuracy evaluations of \nwebsite content authored by registered dietitians versus \nnutritionists found that dietitians provided more accu-\nrate information in two studies based in Canada and the \nUnited States, where the title \u201cnutritionist\u201d is not regu-\nlated [63, 64] However, contrasting results were observed \nin an international analysis of tweets by dietitians, which \nfound that 58% of tweets were not evidence based [53].\nAlthough information posted by Australian nutrition-\nists and dietitians was of the highest quality and accu-\nracy in this study, no posts were classified as excellent \nquality and inaccuracies were detected in over a quarter \nof their posts. In recent years, the public\u2019s trust in nutri-\ntion science has generally eroded [65, 66]. Factors such \nas scientific uncertainty, conflicts of interest \u2013 both real \nand perceived, and insufficient context and contradictory \nmessaging in nutrition communication have diminished \nthe public\u2019s trust in credible and authoritative voices in \nnutrition science.[65, 66] It is important for nutrition \nexperts to post high-quality and accurate information \nto prevent the worsening of mistrust in nutrition sci-\nence. The quality scores observed may reflect the higher \nengagement received by posts that were lower in quality \nand nutrition professionals may be developing content \nthat conforms with what is popular on social media to \nincrease their reach and engagement. Regardless, Aus-\ntralian nutritionists and dietitians should improve the \nquality of their posts by including references, referring \nreaders to relevant health professionals, and ensuring \ninformation is accessible, avoids jargon and is written at \nan appropriate reading level [30, 67]. In this study it was \nrare for nutrition professionals to adequately describe \ntheir qualifications in their Instagram bios. Providing \nmore information about education and accreditation \nmay improve the quality of nutrition professionals\u2019 health \ncommunication and indicate their expertise to consum-\ners [30]. However, increasing transparency regarding \nqualifications may not result in increased uptake of nutri-\ntion advice from credentialed experts, given the public\u2019s \ndiminished trust in the field.\nThis study had a number of key strengths. Use of the \nPRHISM tool to evaluate information quality is a strength \nas it was designed for social media content and measures \naspects of information quality that are unique to social \nmedia [43]. Typically, studies evaluating the quality of \nhealth or nutrition-related social media content have \nused tools developed for different contexts, which may \nnot be appropriate for social media [25]. All posts were \nscreened by two researchers and a random 10% of posts \nwere evaluated twice for reliability. Furthermore, this \nstudy included a large sample of posts collected over a \n12-month period, which may improve the generalisability \nof results. There are also limitations to consider. Firstly, a \nportion of posts were coded as \u201cnot assessable\u201d because \nthe information in the post was not contained in the \nresources used to review accuracy. As such, the amount \nof inaccurate information may have been underestimated \nbecause only common nutrition myths were contained \nin the resources and less common inaccuracies were not. \nSecondly, agreement on reliability measures for quality \nand accuracy evaluations was moderate. However, pro-\ntocols were improved based on common disagreements \nand the remainder of evaluations were done by one \nauthor to improve consistency. Thirdly, it is not possible \nto determine the influence of bots on follower counts or \nTable\u202f5\u2002 Quality scores for nutrition-related Instagram posts by \nprinciple of the PRHISM tool and overall score\nEach principle in PRHISM is scored from 0 to 4, where a higher score indicates \nhigher quality.

Int J Behav Nutr Phys Act           (2024) 21:16 \nIntroduction\nPoor diet quality is the leading preventable risk factor \ncontributing to the global burden of non-communica-\nble disease [1]. Dietary behaviours are complex and are \ninfluenced by a range of factors, including hunger, taste \npreferences, food availability, price, societal norms, and \npolicy context [2]. Nutrition information environments, \nwhich encompass the media and advertising, can also \nexert an influence on dietary behaviours [2]. Social media \nhas recently become a prominent part of the modern \nmedia environment and is a popular vehicle for advertis-\ning, marketing and information sharing. Fifty-nine per-\ncent of the global population are active on social media, \n[3] and social media advertising revenue was projected to \nreach $173 billion USD in 2022 [4]. Food and nutrition \nare popular topics on social media platforms, [5, 6] and \nmarketing of food and supplement products has become \nprolific [7, 8]. There is a growing body of evidence that \nindicates food and nutrition content and marketing \non social media has the power to influence food choice \n[9\u201312].\nAs the Internet has become more accessible, individu-\nals have increasingly utilised it to source information \nabout nutrition. Consumers seek nutrition information \nfor various reasons including health management, curi-\nosity, and interest\u00a0 [13]. Nutrition information is con-\ntent that provides the general public with guidance on \nsourcing, storing, preparing and consuming food to sup-\nport good health, and includes recipes, product details, \nhealthy-eating advice and nutritional requirements \n(defined in full in Table\u00a01). Increases in online nutrition \ninformation seeking behaviour have been observed in \nAmerica, [14] Canada, [15] France, [16] and Norway, [17] \nand the Internet is the primary source of nutrition infor-\nmation for Australians [18, 19]. Social media has become \na ubiquitous part of the Internet and consumers search \nfor and follow food and nutrition-related content on \nsocial media [6, 20\u201322]. A survey of American Instagram \nusers found that 87% of female users followed nutrition-\nrelated content on the platform [6]. Consumers not only \nseek information about food and nutrition on social \nmedia they are also passively exposed to it in their social \nmedia feeds without intentionally searching for it [23, \n24]. Due to the influence of social media algorithms and \npaid sponsorships, social media users are also presented \nwith content in their feed from entities that they do not \nfollow. Furthermore, content can be published by anyone, \nregardless of their qualifications, level of expertise in the \ntopic or conflicting interests.\nAccurate and high-quality information is essential \nfor effective health communication and promotion. In \nhealth communication literature, accuracy refers to \nhealth information\u2019s factual correctness, and quality \nrefers to information\u2019s reliability when assessed using \ndefined quality criteria (see Table\u00a0 1) [25, 26]. Quality \nand accuracy are two important but distinct compo-\nnents of information\u2019s overall reliability. It is possible \nfor information to be accurate but of low quality and \nvice versa. Previous studies have assessed the accu-\nracy of online nutrition information against authorita-\ntive sources such as dietary guidelines, authoritative \nreports and peer reviewed literature [25]. Numerous \nquality assessment tools have been used to evaluate \nthe quality of online nutrition information, such as the \nDISCERN Instrument, [27]. Journal of the American \nMedical Association Benchmarks, [28] and Health on \nthe Net Code Principles [7, 29]. These tools share com-\nmon quality criteria, such as, declaring financial inter-\nests, citing sources, authorship by an individual with \nrelevant health-related qualifications, and disclosure of \nthe author\u2019s qualifications. Principles for Health-related \nInformation on Social Media (PRHISM), is a recently \ndeveloped quality assessment tool, which includes \nthese established quality principles and additional \nprinciples that are relevant to social media, including \naccessibility and readability [30]. There is a broad con-\nsensus in the literature that health information of sub-\noptimal quality and accuracy is extremely prevalent on \nsocial media [26, 31]. Concerningly, misinformation is \noften more popular than truthful information, receives \nhigher user engagement and spreads more quickly than \nthe truth due to its novelty [31, 32]. Furthermore, the \nnarrative of health misinformation often includes and \npromotes mistrust in authoritative institutions and \nTable\u202f1\u2002 Key definitions\na From Denniss et\u00a0al. [25]\nAccuracy: The factual correctness of\u00a0information when\u00a0compared to\u00a0authoritative sources of\u00a0information such as\u00a0systematic reviews, meta analyses \nor\u00a0national dietary guidelines [25].\nQuality: The reliability of\u00a0information as\u00a0assessed by\u00a0quality criteria [26]. Quality criteria typically include components such as\u00a0readability, inclusion of\u00a0ref-\nerences, transparency about\u00a0financial interests and\u00a0disclosure of\u00a0the\u00a0author\u2019s identity and\u00a0qualifications\naNutrition-related information: information regarding\u00a0healthy eating, dietary patterns, nutrients, nutritional requirements, nutritional composition \nof\u00a0foods, nutritional supplements, health outcomes associated with\u00a0foods and\u00a0dietary patterns, food safety, food ethics, cooking and\u00a0recipes intended \nfor\u00a0the\u00a0general public [25].\nPage 3 of 14\nDenniss\u00a0et\u00a0al. Int J Behav Nutr Phys Act           (2024) 21:16 \n\t\nexperts [31]. Social media-based misinformation can \nhave consequences for public health, for example, the \nonline anti-vaccination movement is believed to have \ncontributed to a reduction in vaccination rates and the \nreemergence of previously eradicated communicable \ndiseases [31, 33].\nPublic health nutrition experts and organisations have \nraised concerns about the potential for nutrition-related \nmisinformation to cause serious harm and undermine \ncredible nutrition communication. Exposure to nutri-\ntion information that lacks context or contradicts previ-\nous messaging can lead to confusion and backlash, which \nhas been evidenced to reduce consumers\u2019 willingness \nto engage in healthful behaviours and accept advice by \nauthoritative nutrition experts [34, 35]. If dietary behav-\niours are based on misinformation that contradicts evi-\ndence-based dietary guidelines, it may put individuals at \ngreater risk of developing non-communicable diseases \nthat are associated with unhealthy dietary patterns [1]. A \nrecent systematic review of studies evaluating the quality \nand accuracy of nutrition-related information published \non websites and social media found that generally infor-\nmation was of suboptimal quality and accuracy [25]. A \nsmall number of studies in the review investigated cer-\ntain social media (e.g., blogs, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter \nand WhatsApp), meaning other platforms, such as Insta-\ngram have had limited attention [25]. A further limitation \nwas that quality assessment tools designed for different \nsettings, for example, websites, were used to evaluate the \nsocial media content [25]. Furthermore, it was also rare \nfor studies to involve multiple researchers when screen-\ning posts to evaluate, which is a potential source of bias \n[25]. One recent study that was not captured within the \ndate-range of the systematic review examined the qual-\nity of nutrition-related information on Instagram find-\ning that quality was extremely low [36]. However, this \nstudy measured quality as a single criterion, rather than \nusing an extensive quality assessment method, and thus \nmay not have comprehensively measured the quality of \ninformation.\nTo the knowledge of the authors, thus far no studies \nhave assessed the accuracy of nutrition information on \nInstagram, and none have used social media specific tools \nto evaluate the quality of nutrition-related Instagram \ncontent. Instagram was the third most popular social \nmedia platform in Australia, and the fifth most visited \nwebsite in the world in 2021, [3,\u00a037] and nutrition is one \nof the most frequently discussed health topics on Insta-\ngram [5]. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evalu-\nate the quality and accuracy of nutrition information \nposted by popular Australian Instagram accounts using \nthe PRHISM tool to assess quality. A secondary aim was \nto examine trends in information quality and accuracy by \nauthor, topic, post engagement, account verification and \nnumber of followers.\nMethods\nStudy design and\u00a0data collection\nThe present study involved a cross-sectional evaluation \nof the quality and accuracy of nutrition-related infor-\nmation published on Instagram by Australian influencer \nor brand accounts. The Strengthening the Reporting of \nObservational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guide-\nlines were followed and the checklist is available in Sup-\nplementary Table\u00a01 [38]. A subsample of Instagram posts \ncollected for a wider project formed the dataset for this \nstudy and data collection has been described in detail \nelsewhere [7]. Briefly, a list of the top 1,000 Australian \nhealth Instagram accounts as of April 2021 was screened \nto determine eligibility [39]. Australian accounts with \nover 100,000 followers, a minimum of 100 posts, their \nmost recent post published within two weeks, and a \nminimum of 25% of their content relating to nutrition \nwere included. The figure of 100,000 followers was cho-\nsen because accounts with over 100,000 followers are \nconsidered to be macro influencers or above (over one \nmillion followers is considered to be a mega influencer) \n[40]. Social media users tend to trust the influencers and \nbrands that they follow, [41] and the purpose of this study \nwas to capture information posted by popular Austral-\nian Instagram accounts, therefore, only accounts with \ngreater than 100,000 followers were considered eligible \nfor inclusion. Accounts appearing under the \u201csuggested\u201d \ntab on the Instagram page of included accounts were \nalso screened. Screening was done between May and July \n2021 using an Instagram account made specifically for \nthe project and using Google Chrome\u2019s incognito mode \nto minimise the impact of the algorithm on the sug-\ngested accounts. Two researchers (ED and JV, named in \nacknowledgements) independently screened all accounts \nand disagreements were discussed until agreement was \nreached.\nAll posts by eligible accounts from a twelve-month \nperiod (September 2020 \u2013 September 2021) were down-\nloaded through a paid subscription to Keyhole, an online \nsocial media analytics tool. The data extracted through \nKeyhole included each post\u2019s text-based caption, engage-\nment (sum of likes and comments), the date of upload \nand each account\u2019s bio, number of followers and if it \nwas verified with a blue tick. Each post was manually \nscreened for relevance. Video content including Reels \nand posts that did not refer to one or more component \nof nutrition-related information, as defined in Table\u00a0 1, \nwere excluded. Ten percent of posts were screened inde-\npendently by the lead author (ED) and a research assis-\ntant (JV) for relevance to nutrition information, with 94% \nPage 4 of 14\nDenniss\u00a0et\u00a0al. Int J Behav Nutr Phys Act           (2024) 21:16 \nagreement. The screening resulted in a sample of 10,964 \nInstagram posts containing nutrition-related informa-\ntion, which have been characterised in a previous content \nanalysis study [7].\nFor this study, a random stratified (by Instagram \naccount) subsample of the 10,964 posts were selected and \nscreened further for eligibility. A total of 2,025 posts were \nrandomly selected to be screened (up to 35 posts from \neach of the included Instagram accounts). The random \nsubsample for screening was selected using the sample \nfunction in Stata in March 2022. Posts that promoted a \nproduct but did not include any information about the \nhealth benefits of the product, for example, promotion of \na supplement without mention of its benefits, and posts \nthat only included recipes or meal ideas and no additional \ninformation were excluded because these posts did not \nprovide nutrition guidance that could be evaluated for \naccuracy or quality. All other posts were deemed eligible. \nScreening was done independently by two researchers \n(all posts screened by ED and with secondary screening \nby SM, LM or research assistant JL). Disagreements were \ndiscussed by the two researchers responsible for screen-\ning the relevant post until consensus was reached.\nQuality and\u00a0accuracy evaluations\nThe quality of information was evaluated using the \nPRHISM tool [30]. PRHISM was developed as a tool to \nevaluate the quality of social media-based information \nabout any health-related topic and considers the unique \ncharacteristics of social media content, for example, \ncovert advertising and brevity of information. To the \nknowledge of the authors, PRHISM is the only qual-\nity assessment tool that has been specifically developed \nfor health information delivered via social media. Other \ntools for evaluating the quality of health-related informa-\ntion exist. However, these tools were developed for dif-\nferent settings, such as websites or patient information \npamphlets and their use to evaluate health-related social \nmedia content has been scrutinised in the literature [25, \n42, 43]. PRHISM was developed in a Delphi study, which \ninvolved a panel of 18 expert participants [30]. The par-\nticipants were experts in health communication or a \nhealth-related field, used social media to communicate \nabout health and worked in academia, public health, \ncommunications and/or as health professionals. Three \nDelphi surveys were undertaken to determine group con-\nsensus about the principles to include in PRHISM. Prin-\nciples were based on quality criteria from previous tools \nand adapted to suit social media or were new principles \nsuggested by the expert panel. After the third Delphi sur-\nvey, a draft of the PRHISM scoring tool and guide for use \nwas circulated to participants for feedback about face \nvalidity and participants agreed with the final wording of \nthe principles and guide [30].\nPRHISM consists of thirteen principles that are scored \nfrom zero to four [30]. A number of principles may not \nbe relevant to evaluate depending on the nature of the \nsocial media post being evaluated, for example, principle \n8 relates to privacy and is only relevant to evaluate if the \npost discusses a client or patient. The overall PRHISM \nscore is weighted proportionately as a percentage of the \ntotal available score, whereby principles that are deemed \nnot relevant do not contribute to the total available score. \nThe overall PRHISM score ranges from 0 \u2013 100 where a \nhigher score indicates higher quality. A score of zero to \n25 is considered poor, 26\u2013 50 mediocre, 51 \u2013 75 good \nand 76 \u2013 100 excellent quality [30]. All images and infor-\nmation contained within the post, information in the \naccount holder\u2019s bio and information contained in links \nprovided within the post or bio were considered in qual-\nity evaluations, as outlined in the PRHISM protocol [30]. \nA summary of the PRHISM assessment principles is \nincluded in Table\u00a02.\nTo determine accuracy, the information contained in \nthe Instagram posts was evaluated against information \ncontained in the Australian Dietary Guidelines (ADG) \n[44] Nutrient Reference Values (NRVs), Practice-based \nEvidence in Nutrition Global Resource for Nutrition \nPractice (PEN), [45] and/or Metafact fact-checking plat-\nform. [46] Metafact is a website that enables the public \nto ask questions, which are answered by verified PhDs, \nresearchers and medical specialists.[46] Multiple experts \ncan answer the questions and if\u2009\u2265\u200970% of verified experts \nagree on an answer, it is deemed that consensus has \nbeen achieved [46]. Only questions with consensus were \nused for accuracy evaluations. A large number of posts \nwithin the sample contained claims about the benefits of \ncollagen supplementation for skin health, however, rel-\nevant information was not contained within the chosen \nauthoritative resources. Therefore, a recent systematic \nreview about collagen supplementation was also used to \ndetermine the accuracy of claims about collagen and skin \nhealth [47]. An accuracy coding framework was devel-\noped and was informed by a systematic review of the \nquality and accuracy of online nutrition information [25]. \nPosts were coded as containing information that is com-\npletely inaccurate (0), mostly inaccurate with some accu-\nracies (1), mostly accurate with some inaccuracies (2), \ncompletely accurate (3) or not assessable (4) (see Table\u20092 \nfor descriptions of accuracy categories). All the nutrition \ninformation within a post was considered when evaluat-\ning accuracy. If posts contained information about nutri-\ntion and other topics, such as sleep or exercise, only the \ninformation about nutrition was evaluated. Some posts \ncontained claims about the health benefits of specific \nPage 5 of 14\nDenniss\u00a0et\u00a0al. Int J Behav Nutr Phys Act           (2024) 21:16 \n\t\nproducts, such as supplements, but did not contain suffi-\ncient information about the nutrients or ingredients con-\ntained in the product for an assessment to be made. In \nthese instances, additional information about the prod-\nuct was sourced from its website in order to evaluate the \naccuracy of the claims.\nAssessments were conducted and recorded in a pur-\npose-designed REDCap database. A set of coding rules \nwas developed to ensure that information that appeared \nmultiple times in the sample of posts was coded consist-\nently for accuracy. Before completing the quality and \naccuracy evaluations, a random 10% if the sample was \nevaluated independently by two authors (ED and LM) for \ninter-rater reliability, achieving 79% agreement for quality \ncategory and 85% for accuracy score. Disagreements \nregarding quality or accuracy evaluations were discussed \nby ED and LM until consensus was reached. Common \nreasons for disagreement were discussed and relevant \nupdates to the study protocol were made before the \nremaining evaluations were completed to improve rigor. \nED conducted the quality and accuracy assessments for \nthe remainder of the sample to further improve consist-\nency. Posts containing information that was difficult to \nevaluate were discussed before reaching a decision. Ins-\ntagram accounts and the topic of Instagram posts were \ninductively categorised. The categories for Instagram \naccounts were developed by the two researchers (ED and \nJV) who undertook the screening of Instagram accounts, \nTable\u202f2\u2002 Summary of quality principles assessed by the PRHISM tool and accuracy score categories\nAbbreviations: PRHISM: Principles for Health-related Information on Social Media\na From: Denniss et\u00a0al.

Int J Behav Nutr Phys Act           (2024) 21:16 \nafter screening had concluded and both researchers were \nimmersed in the data. Each included account was inde-\npendently categorised, and disagreements were discussed \nby ED and JV until agreement was reached. The catego-\nries for Instagram accounts were used in the preceding \nstudy for which the data was originally collected [7]. \nCategories for post topic were developed during the reli-\nability assessments based on the most frequent nutrition-\nrelated topics mentioned in the posts and all posts were \ncategorised by the first author. Descriptions of account \nand topic categories are summarised in Supplementary \nTable\u00a02.\nStatistical analysis\nData was exported from REDCap and statistical analyses \nwere performed in Stata/SE v17.0 (StataCorp, College \nStation, TX). Descriptive statistics were run. Multilevel \nmixed-effects models were used to estimate quality \nscores for account categories, post topics, account veri-\nfication, accuracy score, follower count, engagement, \nand engagement rate. Marginal means of quality scores \nfor account categories and post topics were calculated. \nPairwise comparisons were run to determine mean dif-\nferences in quality scores across account categories, post \ntopics and accuracy categories. Mixed-effects ordered \nlogistic regression models were used to estimate accu-\nracy score outcomes for account categories, post top-\nics, account verification, follower count, engagement \nand engagement rate. Pairwise comparisons were run \nto determine mean differences in quality scores across \naccount categories and post topics. Mixed-effects models \nwere chosen to account for the structure of the data, with \nthe possibility of repeat measures (i.e., multiple posts) \nfor each Instagram account, with posts being the unit \nof analysis and the models including random intercepts \nfor Instagram accounts. Quality and accuracy scores \nwere treated as the dependent variable. Engagement and \nengagement rate had positively skewed distributions and \nwere log transformed. One account had an outlying num-\nber of followers (>\u20092,000,000) and was thus removed from \nanalyses involving follower counts. After removing the \noutlying account, follower counts remained skewed and \nwere also log transformed to achieve normal distribution. \nAnalysis was run with and without the outlying account \nshowing little difference to the result (data not shown). \nStatistical significance was set at P\u2009<\u20090.05.\nEthics\nThe Instagram posts included in this study were pub-\nlicly available. Due to the public nature of the data, this \nstudy was exempt from formal review by an ethics com-\nmittee. To ensure that this study upholds ethical research \nstandards, no identifying information about the account-\nholders has been published.\nResults\nA total of 676 posts from 47 accounts were included in \nthe final sample (Fig.\u00a01, Table\u00a03). Accounts had an aver-\nage of 314,817 followers. The most common topic dis-\ncussed in posts was supplements (36.4%) followed by \nfoods/nutrients and health (17.2%), general healthy eat-\ning (16.0%), weight loss (13.5%), sports/exercise nutrition \n(6.7%), other (5.5%) and paediatric nutrition (4.9%).\nQuality\nOverall, 34.8% (n\u2009=\u2009235) of posts were classified as poor, \n59.2% (n\u2009=\u2009400) mediocre, 6.1% (n\u2009=\u200941) good and zero \nposts were classified as excellent quality. The mean \nPRHISM score was mediocre (31.8\u2009\u00b1\u200910.3 out of a pos-\nsible score of 100) and scores varied across principles \n(Table\u00a0 4). Only two principles had a mean score above \ntwo (4. Financial disclosure and 13. Images) (Table\u00a0 5). \nPosts authored by accounts in the nutritionist/dietitian \ninfluencer account category were associated with higher \nquality scores compared to the reference group (brands) \n(\u03b2, 17.8, CI 13.94\u201321.65; P\u2009<\u20090.001) and all other account \ncategories. Posts that contained information about foods/\nnutrients and health or general healthy eating were \nassociated with higher quality scores compared to the \nreference group (weight loss information) and posts con-\ntaining information about supplements. There was no \nassociation between information quality and accounts \nbeing verified (\u03b2 0.572, P\u2009=\u20090.821) or follower count (\u03b2 \n-1.18, P\u2009=\u20090.643). Lower quality scores were associated \nwith higher engagement (\u03b2 -0.59, P\u2009=\u20090.012) and higher \nengagement rate (\u03b2 -0.57, P\u2009=\u20090.016), although these dif-\nferences were small. A complete summary of the results \nfrom the mixed effects analysis of quality scores by \naccount type and post topic is provided in Supplemen-\ntary Table\u00a03 and 4.\nAccuracy\nFrom the 676 posts included in the sample, 166 were not \nassessable and a total of 510 posts were evaluated for \naccuracy (see Fig.\u00a0 1). Of the posts that were evaluated \nfor accuracy, 44.7% (n\u2009=\u2009228) of posts contained inac-\ncuracies, 8.6% (n\u2009=\u200944) of posts were completely inac-\ncurate, 14.3% (n\u2009=\u200973) mostly inaccurate, 21.8% (111) \nmostly accurate and 55.3% (n\u2009=\u2009282) completely accurate. \nPosts published by fitness influencers had higher odds of \nreceiving a higher score for accuracy compared to posts \npublished by brands (OR 3.09, CI 1.21\u20137.87, P\u2009=\u20090.018) \nas did posts published by nutritionist/dietitian influencer \naccounts (OR 4.69, CI 1.81\u201312.14, P\u2009=\u20090.001). In terms of \ntopics, posts containing information about supplements \nPage 7 of 14\nDenniss\u00a0et\u00a0al.

There was no difference in odds of receiving a \nhigher accuracy score for posts authored by a verified or \nnon-verified account (OR 2.07, CI 0.87\u20134.94, P\u2009=\u20090.10), \nfollower count (OR 1.12, CI 0.46\u20132.69, P\u2009=\u20090.803), \nengagement (OR 1.02, CI 0.84\u20131.24, P\u2009=\u20090.831) or engage-\nment rate (OR 1.0, CI 0.82\u20131.21, P\u2009=\u20090.960). A complete \nsummary of the results from the mixed effects analysis \nof accuracy scores by account type and post topic is pro-\nvided in Supplementary Table\u00a03 and 4.\nPosts that were completely accurate were associated \nwith higher quality scores compared to posts that were \ncompletely inaccurate (\u03b2 2.24, CI 0.29\u20134.19, P\u2009=\u20090.024). \nHowever, the differences in quality scores between posts \ncontaining completely accurate versus completely inac-\ncurate information was small. There was no difference in \nquality scores observed for posts containing mostly inac-\ncurate or mostly accurate information.\nDiscussion\nThis content analysis study evaluated the quality and \naccuracy of nutrition-related information posted by \npopular Australian Instagram accounts. Results indicate \nFig.\u202f1\u2002 Flow chart of\u00a0sample selection process\nPage 8 of 14\nDenniss\u00a0et\u00a0al. Int J Behav Nutr Phys Act           (2024) 21:16 \nthat most information posted by Australian accounts is of \nlow to moderate quality and almost half of posts contain \ninaccuracies. Information about supplements or posted \nby brand accounts tended to be of lower quality and \naccuracy compared to other topics and authors of infor-\nmation. Australian nutritionist and dietitian accounts \nposted higher quality information that was more likely to \nbe accurate.\nOverall, the quality and accuracy of nutrition-related \nInstagram posts included in this study was poor and \nposts that were of lower quality received higher engage-\nment. These findings are consistent with content analyses \nof nutrition-related information from YouTube, [48\u201351] \nInstagram, [36] WhatsApp, [52] Twitter, [53] Facebook, \n[54] and blogs, [55] which found large proportions of \ninaccurate and poor quality information. Furthermore, a \nstudy on YouTube videos about nutrition following bari-\natric surgery found that poor quality and inaccurate vid-\neos were the most popular [50]. Conversely, studies about \nhealthy eating information on blogs [56] and information \nabout food safety and eating for coeliac disease on You-\nTube [57, 58] have found information to be accurate and \nof fair to high quality. More broadly, studies about health-\nrelated information on social media have found that \nhealth misinformation is abundant on social media plat-\nforms and is often more popular than factual information \n[31]. A small association between information accuracy \nand quality was observed, which is consistent with previ-\nous research that has seen a very weak correlation [59] \nor no correlation [60] between the quality and accuracy \nof nutrition-related information. Findings from this study \nand the health and nutrition communication literature \nsuggest that Instagram and other social media users are \nlikely to be exposed to suboptimal and misleading nutri-\ntion information. Furthermore, over a third of posts in \nthis study contained a combination of accurate and inac-\ncurate information, which may make it difficult for con-\nsumers to identify accurate information when engaging \nwith nutrition-related posts by Australian accounts. The \ngenerally low PRHISM scores that Australian accounts \nreceived suggest that consumers may be presented with \ninformation that is difficult to understand and lacks suf-\nficient context or evidence, which may undermine public \nhealth nutrition efforts and contribute to confusion and \nbacklash [34, 35].\nInformation about supplements and information \nposted by brand accounts was of the lowest quality and \naccuracy consistent with existing research. A systematic \nreview of the quality and accuracy of online nutrition \ninformation found that information published by com-\nmercial entities was often of the lowest quality and accu-\nracy, however, this finding was not consistent throughout \nthe included studies and there was variation in which \npublishers provided the most reliable information [25]. \nThe same review also found that information about sup-\nplements was typically inaccurate and of low quality [25]. \nSimilarly, Basch et\u00a0al. found that YouTube videos about \nmultivitamin supplements were of poor quality, [49] and \na small analysis of Instagram posts containing #immune-\nbooster found numerous inaccurate claims about the \nimmune boosting benefits of supplements during the \nCOVID-19 pandemic [61].

In 2022, \nan Australian supplement company with a large social \nmedia presence was fined $26,640 AUD by the Therapeu-\ntic Goods Administration for unlawful claims about their \nsupplements and cancer and Alzheimer\u2019s prevention [62]. \nMore frequent and severe prosecution for misleading \ninformation may help disincentivise commercial entities \nfrom making false claims.\nIn this study posts by Australian nutritionists and \ndietitians generally received higher quality and accuracy \nscores than posts by other accounts. This is consistent \nwith results from a recent analysis of nutrition-related \nInstagram content, where posts categorised as \u201cnutrition \nand dietetics\u201d received higher quality evaluations com-\npared to other categories such as \u201cfitness\u201d and \u201cmotiva-\ntion\u201d [36]. Furthermore, previous accuracy evaluations of \nwebsite content authored by registered dietitians versus \nnutritionists found that dietitians provided more accu-\nrate information in two studies based in Canada and the \nUnited States, where the title \u201cnutritionist\u201d is not regu-\nlated [63, 64] However, contrasting results were observed \nin an international analysis of tweets by dietitians, which \nfound that 58% of tweets were not evidence based [53].\nAlthough information posted by Australian nutrition-\nists and dietitians was of the highest quality and accu-\nracy in this study, no posts were classified as excellent \nquality and inaccuracies were detected in over a quarter \nof their posts. In recent years, the public\u2019s trust in nutri-\ntion science has generally eroded [65, 66]. Factors such \nas scientific uncertainty, conflicts of interest \u2013 both real \nand perceived, and insufficient context and contradictory \nmessaging in nutrition communication have diminished \nthe public\u2019s trust in credible and authoritative voices in \nnutrition science.[65, 66] It is important for nutrition \nexperts to post high-quality and accurate information \nto prevent the worsening of mistrust in nutrition sci-\nence. The quality scores observed may reflect the higher \nengagement received by posts that were lower in quality \nand nutrition professionals may be developing content \nthat conforms with what is popular on social media to \nincrease their reach and engagement. Regardless, Aus-\ntralian nutritionists and dietitians should improve the \nquality of their posts by including references, referring \nreaders to relevant health professionals, and ensuring \ninformation is accessible, avoids jargon and is written at \nan appropriate reading level [30, 67]. In this study it was \nrare for nutrition professionals to adequately describe \ntheir qualifications in their Instagram bios. Providing \nmore information about education and accreditation \nmay improve the quality of nutrition professionals\u2019 health \ncommunication and indicate their expertise to consum-\ners [30]. However, increasing transparency regarding \nqualifications may not result in increased uptake of nutri-\ntion advice from credentialed experts, given the public\u2019s \ndiminished trust in the field.\nThis study had a number of key strengths. Use of the \nPRHISM tool to evaluate information quality is a strength \nas it was designed for social media content and measures \naspects of information quality that are unique to social \nmedia [43]. Typically, studies evaluating the quality of \nhealth or nutrition-related social media content have \nused tools developed for different contexts, which may \nnot be appropriate for social media [25]. All posts were \nscreened by two researchers and a random 10% of posts \nwere evaluated twice for reliability. Furthermore, this \nstudy included a large sample of posts collected over a \n12-month period, which may improve the generalisability \nof results. There are also limitations to consider. Firstly, a \nportion of posts were coded as \u201cnot assessable\u201d because \nthe information in the post was not contained in the \nresources used to review accuracy. As such, the amount \nof inaccurate information may have been underestimated \nbecause only common nutrition myths were contained \nin the resources and less common inaccuracies were not. \nSecondly, agreement on reliability measures for quality \nand accuracy evaluations was moderate. However, pro-\ntocols were improved based on common disagreements \nand the remainder of evaluations were done by one \nauthor to improve consistency. Thirdly, it is not possible \nto determine the influence of bots on follower counts or \nTable\u202f5\u2002 Quality scores for nutrition-related Instagram posts by \nprinciple of the PRHISM tool and overall score\nEach principle in PRHISM is scored from 0 to 4, where a higher score indicates \nhigher quality.

This is because \nbots are difficult to detect and Instagram restricts access \nto their application programming interface (API), mean-\ning that much of Instagram\u2019s data cannot be accessed or \nsystematically searched. However, limited access to APIs \nand the influence of algorithms and bots are common \nlimitations in social media research. Fourthly, the Insta-\ngram data used in this study was sourced from Australian \nInstagram accounts and may therefore not be generalis-\nable to nutrition-related Instagram content published in \ndifferent geographical locations. Finally, Reels and other \nvideo content was not included in this study because it \nwas not feasible to transcribe video content for analy-\nsis. Reels have grown in popularity since the data was \ncollected [68] and future research should investigate \nthe quality and accuracy of nutrition-related Instagram \nReels.\nFindings from this content analysis have implications \nfor policy, practice, and future research. In Australia \nregulatory bodies have handed down fines for mislead-\ning claims, [62] prohibited influencer marketing of \ntherapeutic goods, such as supplements, [69] and put \na call out to social media users to report influencers \nwho do not disclose brand partnerships [70]. These are \npromising steps toward curbing unreliable health and \nnutrition misinformation. However, regulatory bodies \nand the public should not bear all responsibility and \ndo not have sufficient resources for comprehensive \nsurveillance and monitoring of social media and the \nfindings from this study highlight the failure of cur-\nrent public health measures to adequately tackle this \nissue in Australia. Social media companies should do \nmore to regulate content on their platforms, which is \nstrongly recommended by the World Health Organiza-\ntion [71]. For example, social media platforms could \nverify the qualifications of health professionals and \nintroduce features that enable content creators to \neasily include references in posts and refer individu-\nals to local health organisations to improve credible \ncommunication that aligns with PRHISM and World \nHealth Organization recommendations [30, 71]. Fur-\nthermore, the current system that social media, food, \nwellness and supplement companies operate within, \nprioritises profit over human and planetary health \nand is acknowledged within commercial determinants \nof health framework [72]. A substantial reorientation \nof this system to prioritise health over profit may be \nmore effective for preventing health misinformation \nthan reprimanding individual influencers or brands \nfor misleading consumers. Nutrition experts also \nhave a role to play and should ensure that the con-\ntent they publish on social media is accurate and of a \nhigh quality. Support for nutritionists, dietitians, and \nother experts can be provided by professional bod-\nies and institutions to embed media and communica-\ntions training within tertiary education and continuing \nprofessional development. Nutrition communication \nhas been outlined as a priority area in the Australian \nNational Committee for Nutrition decadal plan for \nthe science of nutrition, highlighting the importance \nof communication to the field of nutrition [73]. Future \nresearch should characterise who is exposed to nutri-\ntion misinformation, and who engages with, shares \nand believes misinformation. Additionally, more work \nis needed to understand how nutrition misinforma-\ntion may be influencing the dietary choices consum-\ners are making. Further analysis by topic may also yield \nhelpful insights. Considering the importance of infant \nnutrition, the paediatric topic area could be a signifi-\ncant are to focus future efforts. Finally, research is \nneeded to develop methods of measuring health mis-\ninformation\u2019s severity and potential for harm so that \npotential impacts can be estimated.\nConclusion\nThis content analysis found that a large proportion of \nnutrition-related information posted by influential Aus-\ntralian Instagram accounts is of suboptimal quality and \naccuracy. Instagram users who follow and engage with \nnutrition-related Instagram content posted by Austral-\nian influencers and brands may be at risk of being mis-\ninformed. Information about supplements and content \nposted by brand accounts was more likely to contain \ninaccuracies and be of lower quality. Posts by dieti-\ntians and nutritionists were higher in quality and more \nlikely to be accurate. The public should be sceptical of \nthe credibility of nutrition-related Instagram content \nthat includes marketing and seek out information pro-\nvided by nutritionists and dietitians over other entities \non Instagram. Although information posted by Austral-\nian dietitians and nutritionists was of the highest qual-\nity and accuracy, there is scope for improvement and \nnutrition experts should prioritise providing credible \nand reliable nutrition communication on social media.\nAbbreviations\nADG\t\n\u0007Australian Dietary Guidelines\nNRV\t\n\u0007Nutrient Reference Values\nPEN\t\n\u0007Practice-based Evidence in Nutrition\nPRHISM\t\n\u0007Principles for Health-related Information on Social Media\nSTROBE\t\n\u0007Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology\n"

Int J Behav Nutr Phys Act           (2024) 21:16 \nIntroduction\nPoor diet quality is the leading preventable risk factor \ncontributing to the global burden of non-communica-\nble disease [1]. Dietary behaviours are complex and are \ninfluenced by a range of factors, including hunger, taste \npreferences, food availability, price, societal norms, and \npolicy context [2]. Nutrition information environments, \nwhich encompass the media and advertising, can also \nexert an influence on dietary behaviours [2]. Social media \nhas recently become a prominent part of the modern \nmedia environment and is a popular vehicle for advertis-\ning, marketing and information sharing. Fifty-nine per-\ncent of the global population are active on social media, \n[3] and social media advertising revenue was projected to \nreach $173 billion USD in 2022 [4]. Food and nutrition \nare popular topics on social media platforms, [5, 6] and \nmarketing of food and supplement products has become \nprolific [7, 8]. There is a growing body of evidence that \nindicates food and nutrition content and marketing \non social media has the power to influence food choice \n[9\u201312].\nAs the Internet has become more accessible, individu-\nals have increasingly utilised it to source information \nabout nutrition. Consumers seek nutrition information \nfor various reasons including health management, curi-\nosity, and interest\u00a0 [13]. Nutrition information is con-\ntent that provides the general public with guidance on \nsourcing, storing, preparing and consuming food to sup-\nport good health, and includes recipes, product details, \nhealthy-eating advice and nutritional requirements \n(defined in full in Table\u00a01). Increases in online nutrition \ninformation seeking behaviour have been observed in \nAmerica, [14] Canada, [15] France, [16] and Norway, [17] \nand the Internet is the primary source of nutrition infor-\nmation for Australians [18, 19]. Social media has become \na ubiquitous part of the Internet and consumers search \nfor and follow food and nutrition-related content on \nsocial media [6, 20\u201322]. A survey of American Instagram \nusers found that 87% of female users followed nutrition-\nrelated content on the platform [6]. Consumers not only \nseek information about food and nutrition on social \nmedia they are also passively exposed to it in their social \nmedia feeds without intentionally searching for it [23, \n24]. Due to the influence of social media algorithms and \npaid sponsorships, social media users are also presented \nwith content in their feed from entities that they do not \nfollow. Furthermore, content can be published by anyone, \nregardless of their qualifications, level of expertise in the \ntopic or conflicting interests.\nAccurate and high-quality information is essential \nfor effective health communication and promotion. In \nhealth communication literature, accuracy refers to \nhealth information\u2019s factual correctness, and quality \nrefers to information\u2019s reliability when assessed using \ndefined quality criteria (see Table\u00a0 1) [25, 26]. Quality \nand accuracy are two important but distinct compo-\nnents of information\u2019s overall reliability. It is possible \nfor information to be accurate but of low quality and \nvice versa. Previous studies have assessed the accu-\nracy of online nutrition information against authorita-\ntive sources such as dietary guidelines, authoritative \nreports and peer reviewed literature [25]. Numerous \nquality assessment tools have been used to evaluate \nthe quality of online nutrition information, such as the \nDISCERN Instrument, [27]. Journal of the American \nMedical Association Benchmarks, [28] and Health on \nthe Net Code Principles [7, 29]. These tools share com-\nmon quality criteria, such as, declaring financial inter-\nests, citing sources, authorship by an individual with \nrelevant health-related qualifications, and disclosure of \nthe author\u2019s qualifications. Principles for Health-related \nInformation on Social Media (PRHISM), is a recently \ndeveloped quality assessment tool, which includes \nthese established quality principles and additional \nprinciples that are relevant to social media, including \naccessibility and readability [30]. There is a broad con-\nsensus in the literature that health information of sub-\noptimal quality and accuracy is extremely prevalent on \nsocial media [26, 31]. Concerningly, misinformation is \noften more popular than truthful information, receives \nhigher user engagement and spreads more quickly than \nthe truth due to its novelty [31, 32]. Furthermore, the \nnarrative of health misinformation often includes and \npromotes mistrust in authoritative institutions and \nTable\u202f1\u2002 Key definitions\na From Denniss et\u00a0al. [25]\nAccuracy: The factual correctness of\u00a0information when\u00a0compared to\u00a0authoritative sources of\u00a0information such as\u00a0systematic reviews, meta analyses \nor\u00a0national dietary guidelines [25].\nQuality: The reliability of\u00a0information as\u00a0assessed by\u00a0quality criteria [26]. Quality criteria typically include components such as\u00a0readability, inclusion of\u00a0ref-\nerences, transparency about\u00a0financial interests and\u00a0disclosure of\u00a0the\u00a0author\u2019s identity and\u00a0qualifications\naNutrition-related information: information regarding\u00a0healthy eating, dietary patterns, nutrients, nutritional requirements, nutritional composition \nof\u00a0foods, nutritional supplements, health outcomes associated with\u00a0foods and\u00a0dietary patterns, food safety, food ethics, cooking and\u00a0recipes intended \nfor\u00a0the\u00a0general public [25].\nPage 3 of 14\nDenniss\u00a0et\u00a0al. Int J Behav Nutr Phys Act           (2024) 21:16 \n\t\nexperts [31]. Social media-based misinformation can \nhave consequences for public health, for example, the \nonline anti-vaccination movement is believed to have \ncontributed to a reduction in vaccination rates and the \nreemergence of previously eradicated communicable \ndiseases [31, 33].\nPublic health nutrition experts and organisations have \nraised concerns about the potential for nutrition-related \nmisinformation to cause serious harm and undermine \ncredible nutrition communication. Exposure to nutri-\ntion information that lacks context or contradicts previ-\nous messaging can lead to confusion and backlash, which \nhas been evidenced to reduce consumers\u2019 willingness \nto engage in healthful behaviours and accept advice by \nauthoritative nutrition experts [34, 35]. If dietary behav-\niours are based on misinformation that contradicts evi-\ndence-based dietary guidelines, it may put individuals at \ngreater risk of developing non-communicable diseases \nthat are associated with unhealthy dietary patterns [1]. A \nrecent systematic review of studies evaluating the quality \nand accuracy of nutrition-related information published \non websites and social media found that generally infor-\nmation was of suboptimal quality and accuracy [25]. A \nsmall number of studies in the review investigated cer-\ntain social media (e.g., blogs, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter \nand WhatsApp), meaning other platforms, such as Insta-\ngram have had limited attention [25]. A further limitation \nwas that quality assessment tools designed for different \nsettings, for example, websites, were used to evaluate the \nsocial media content [25]. Furthermore, it was also rare \nfor studies to involve multiple researchers when screen-\ning posts to evaluate, which is a potential source of bias \n[25]. One recent study that was not captured within the \ndate-range of the systematic review examined the qual-\nity of nutrition-related information on Instagram find-\ning that quality was extremely low [36]. However, this \nstudy measured quality as a single criterion, rather than \nusing an extensive quality assessment method, and thus \nmay not have comprehensively measured the quality of \ninformation.\nTo the knowledge of the authors, thus far no studies \nhave assessed the accuracy of nutrition information on \nInstagram, and none have used social media specific tools \nto evaluate the quality of nutrition-related Instagram \ncontent. Instagram was the third most popular social \nmedia platform in Australia, and the fifth most visited \nwebsite in the world in 2021, [3,\u00a037] and nutrition is one \nof the most frequently discussed health topics on Insta-\ngram [5]. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evalu-\nate the quality and accuracy of nutrition information \nposted by popular Australian Instagram accounts using \nthe PRHISM tool to assess quality. A secondary aim was \nto examine trends in information quality and accuracy by \nauthor, topic, post engagement, account verification and \nnumber of followers.\nMethods\nStudy design and\u00a0data collection\nThe present study involved a cross-sectional evaluation \nof the quality and accuracy of nutrition-related infor-\nmation published on Instagram by Australian influencer \nor brand accounts. The Strengthening the Reporting of \nObservational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guide-\nlines were followed and the checklist is available in Sup-\nplementary Table\u00a01 [38]. A subsample of Instagram posts \ncollected for a wider project formed the dataset for this \nstudy and data collection has been described in detail \nelsewhere [7]. Briefly, a list of the top 1,000 Australian \nhealth Instagram accounts as of April 2021 was screened \nto determine eligibility [39]. Australian accounts with \nover 100,000 followers, a minimum of 100 posts, their \nmost recent post published within two weeks, and a \nminimum of 25% of their content relating to nutrition \nwere included. The figure of 100,000 followers was cho-\nsen because accounts with over 100,000 followers are \nconsidered to be macro influencers or above (over one \nmillion followers is considered to be a mega influencer) \n[40]. Social media users tend to trust the influencers and \nbrands that they follow, [41] and the purpose of this study \nwas to capture information posted by popular Austral-\nian Instagram accounts, therefore, only accounts with \ngreater than 100,000 followers were considered eligible \nfor inclusion. Accounts appearing under the \u201csuggested\u201d \ntab on the Instagram page of included accounts were \nalso screened. Screening was done between May and July \n2021 using an Instagram account made specifically for \nthe project and using Google Chrome\u2019s incognito mode \nto minimise the impact of the algorithm on the sug-\ngested accounts. Two researchers (ED and JV, named in \nacknowledgements) independently screened all accounts \nand disagreements were discussed until agreement was \nreached.\nAll posts by eligible accounts from a twelve-month \nperiod (September 2020 \u2013 September 2021) were down-\nloaded through a paid subscription to Keyhole, an online \nsocial media analytics tool. The data extracted through \nKeyhole included each post\u2019s text-based caption, engage-\nment (sum of likes and comments), the date of upload \nand each account\u2019s bio, number of followers and if it \nwas verified with a blue tick. Each post was manually \nscreened for relevance. Video content including Reels \nand posts that did not refer to one or more component \nof nutrition-related information, as defined in Table\u00a0 1, \nwere excluded. Ten percent of posts were screened inde-\npendently by the lead author (ED) and a research assis-\ntant (JV) for relevance to nutrition information, with 94% \nPage 4 of 14\nDenniss\u00a0et\u00a0al. Int J Behav Nutr Phys Act           (2024) 21:16 \nagreement. The screening resulted in a sample of 10,964 \nInstagram posts containing nutrition-related informa-\ntion, which have been characterised in a previous content \nanalysis study [7].\nFor this study, a random stratified (by Instagram \naccount) subsample of the 10,964 posts were selected and \nscreened further for eligibility. A total of 2,025 posts were \nrandomly selected to be screened (up to 35 posts from \neach of the included Instagram accounts). The random \nsubsample for screening was selected using the sample \nfunction in Stata in March 2022. Posts that promoted a \nproduct but did not include any information about the \nhealth benefits of the product, for example, promotion of \na supplement without mention of its benefits, and posts \nthat only included recipes or meal ideas and no additional \ninformation were excluded because these posts did not \nprovide nutrition guidance that could be evaluated for \naccuracy or quality. All other posts were deemed eligible. \nScreening was done independently by two researchers \n(all posts screened by ED and with secondary screening \nby SM, LM or research assistant JL). Disagreements were \ndiscussed by the two researchers responsible for screen-\ning the relevant post until consensus was reached.\nQuality and\u00a0accuracy evaluations\nThe quality of information was evaluated using the \nPRHISM tool [30]. PRHISM was developed as a tool to \nevaluate the quality of social media-based information \nabout any health-related topic and considers the unique \ncharacteristics of social media content, for example, \ncovert advertising and brevity of information. To the \nknowledge of the authors, PRHISM is the only qual-\nity assessment tool that has been specifically developed \nfor health information delivered via social media. Other \ntools for evaluating the quality of health-related informa-\ntion exist. However, these tools were developed for dif-\nferent settings, such as websites or patient information \npamphlets and their use to evaluate health-related social \nmedia content has been scrutinised in the literature [25, \n42, 43]. PRHISM was developed in a Delphi study, which \ninvolved a panel of 18 expert participants [30]. The par-\nticipants were experts in health communication or a \nhealth-related field, used social media to communicate \nabout health and worked in academia, public health, \ncommunications and/or as health professionals. Three \nDelphi surveys were undertaken to determine group con-\nsensus about the principles to include in PRHISM. Prin-\nciples were based on quality criteria from previous tools \nand adapted to suit social media or were new principles \nsuggested by the expert panel. After the third Delphi sur-\nvey, a draft of the PRHISM scoring tool and guide for use \nwas circulated to participants for feedback about face \nvalidity and participants agreed with the final wording of \nthe principles and guide [30].\nPRHISM consists of thirteen principles that are scored \nfrom zero to four [30]. A number of principles may not \nbe relevant to evaluate depending on the nature of the \nsocial media post being evaluated, for example, principle \n8 relates to privacy and is only relevant to evaluate if the \npost discusses a client or patient. The overall PRHISM \nscore is weighted proportionately as a percentage of the \ntotal available score, whereby principles that are deemed \nnot relevant do not contribute to the total available score. \nThe overall PRHISM score ranges from 0 \u2013 100 where a \nhigher score indicates higher quality. A score of zero to \n25 is considered poor, 26\u2013 50 mediocre, 51 \u2013 75 good \nand 76 \u2013 100 excellent quality [30]. All images and infor-\nmation contained within the post, information in the \naccount holder\u2019s bio and information contained in links \nprovided within the post or bio were considered in qual-\nity evaluations, as outlined in the PRHISM protocol [30]. \nA summary of the PRHISM assessment principles is \nincluded in Table\u00a02.\nTo determine accuracy, the information contained in \nthe Instagram posts was evaluated against information \ncontained in the Australian Dietary Guidelines (ADG) \n[44] Nutrient Reference Values (NRVs), Practice-based \nEvidence in Nutrition Global Resource for Nutrition \nPractice (PEN), [45] and/or Metafact fact-checking plat-\nform. [46] Metafact is a website that enables the public \nto ask questions, which are answered by verified PhDs, \nresearchers and medical specialists.[46] Multiple experts \ncan answer the questions and if\u2009\u2265\u200970% of verified experts \nagree on an answer, it is deemed that consensus has \nbeen achieved [46]. Only questions with consensus were \nused for accuracy evaluations. A large number of posts \nwithin the sample contained claims about the benefits of \ncollagen supplementation for skin health, however, rel-\nevant information was not contained within the chosen \nauthoritative resources. Therefore, a recent systematic \nreview about collagen supplementation was also used to \ndetermine the accuracy of claims about collagen and skin \nhealth [47]. An accuracy coding framework was devel-\noped and was informed by a systematic review of the \nquality and accuracy of online nutrition information [25]. \nPosts were coded as containing information that is com-\npletely inaccurate (0), mostly inaccurate with some accu-\nracies (1), mostly accurate with some inaccuracies (2), \ncompletely accurate (3) or not assessable (4) (see Table\u20092 \nfor descriptions of accuracy categories). All the nutrition \ninformation within a post was considered when evaluat-\ning accuracy. If posts contained information about nutri-\ntion and other topics, such as sleep or exercise, only the \ninformation about nutrition was evaluated. Some posts \ncontained claims about the health benefits of specific \nPage 5 of 14\nDenniss\u00a0et\u00a0al. Int J Behav Nutr Phys Act           (2024) 21:16 \n\t\nproducts, such as supplements, but did not contain suffi-\ncient information about the nutrients or ingredients con-\ntained in the product for an assessment to be made. In \nthese instances, additional information about the prod-\nuct was sourced from its website in order to evaluate the \naccuracy of the claims.\nAssessments were conducted and recorded in a pur-\npose-designed REDCap database. A set of coding rules \nwas developed to ensure that information that appeared \nmultiple times in the sample of posts was coded consist-\nently for accuracy. Before completing the quality and \naccuracy evaluations, a random 10% if the sample was \nevaluated independently by two authors (ED and LM) for \ninter-rater reliability, achieving 79% agreement for quality \ncategory and 85% for accuracy score. Disagreements \nregarding quality or accuracy evaluations were discussed \nby ED and LM until consensus was reached. Common \nreasons for disagreement were discussed and relevant \nupdates to the study protocol were made before the \nremaining evaluations were completed to improve rigor. \nED conducted the quality and accuracy assessments for \nthe remainder of the sample to further improve consist-\nency. Posts containing information that was difficult to \nevaluate were discussed before reaching a decision. Ins-\ntagram accounts and the topic of Instagram posts were \ninductively categorised. The categories for Instagram \naccounts were developed by the two researchers (ED and \nJV) who undertook the screening of Instagram accounts, \nTable\u202f2\u2002 Summary of quality principles assessed by the PRHISM tool and accuracy score categories\nAbbreviations: PRHISM: Principles for Health-related Information on Social Media\na From: Denniss et\u00a0al.

Each included account was inde-\npendently categorised, and disagreements were discussed \nby ED and JV until agreement was reached. The catego-\nries for Instagram accounts were used in the preceding \nstudy for which the data was originally collected [7]. \nCategories for post topic were developed during the reli-\nability assessments based on the most frequent nutrition-\nrelated topics mentioned in the posts and all posts were \ncategorised by the first author. Descriptions of account \nand topic categories are summarised in Supplementary \nTable\u00a02.\nStatistical analysis\nData was exported from REDCap and statistical analyses \nwere performed in Stata/SE v17.0 (StataCorp, College \nStation, TX). Descriptive statistics were run. Multilevel \nmixed-effects models were used to estimate quality \nscores for account categories, post topics, account veri-\nfication, accuracy score, follower count, engagement, \nand engagement rate. Marginal means of quality scores \nfor account categories and post topics were calculated. \nPairwise comparisons were run to determine mean dif-\nferences in quality scores across account categories, post \ntopics and accuracy categories. Mixed-effects ordered \nlogistic regression models were used to estimate accu-\nracy score outcomes for account categories, post top-\nics, account verification, follower count, engagement \nand engagement rate. Pairwise comparisons were run \nto determine mean differences in quality scores across \naccount categories and post topics. Mixed-effects models \nwere chosen to account for the structure of the data, with \nthe possibility of repeat measures (i.e., multiple posts) \nfor each Instagram account, with posts being the unit \nof analysis and the models including random intercepts \nfor Instagram accounts. Quality and accuracy scores \nwere treated as the dependent variable. Engagement and \nengagement rate had positively skewed distributions and \nwere log transformed. One account had an outlying num-\nber of followers (>\u20092,000,000) and was thus removed from \nanalyses involving follower counts. After removing the \noutlying account, follower counts remained skewed and \nwere also log transformed to achieve normal distribution. \nAnalysis was run with and without the outlying account \nshowing little difference to the result (data not shown). \nStatistical significance was set at P\u2009<\u20090.05.\nEthics\nThe Instagram posts included in this study were pub-\nlicly available. Due to the public nature of the data, this \nstudy was exempt from formal review by an ethics com-\nmittee. To ensure that this study upholds ethical research \nstandards, no identifying information about the account-\nholders has been published.\nResults\nA total of 676 posts from 47 accounts were included in \nthe final sample (Fig.\u00a01, Table\u00a03). Accounts had an aver-\nage of 314,817 followers. The most common topic dis-\ncussed in posts was supplements (36.4%) followed by \nfoods/nutrients and health (17.2%), general healthy eat-\ning (16.0%), weight loss (13.5%), sports/exercise nutrition \n(6.7%), other (5.5%) and paediatric nutrition (4.9%).\nQuality\nOverall, 34.8% (n\u2009=\u2009235) of posts were classified as poor, \n59.2% (n\u2009=\u2009400) mediocre, 6.1% (n\u2009=\u200941) good and zero \nposts were classified as excellent quality. The mean \nPRHISM score was mediocre (31.8\u2009\u00b1\u200910.3 out of a pos-\nsible score of 100) and scores varied across principles \n(Table\u00a0 4). Only two principles had a mean score above \ntwo (4. Financial disclosure and 13. Images) (Table\u00a0 5). \nPosts authored by accounts in the nutritionist/dietitian \ninfluencer account category were associated with higher \nquality scores compared to the reference group (brands) \n(\u03b2, 17.8, CI 13.94\u201321.65; P\u2009<\u20090.001) and all other account \ncategories. Posts that contained information about foods/\nnutrients and health or general healthy eating were \nassociated with higher quality scores compared to the \nreference group (weight loss information) and posts con-\ntaining information about supplements. There was no \nassociation between information quality and accounts \nbeing verified (\u03b2 0.572, P\u2009=\u20090.821) or follower count (\u03b2 \n-1.18, P\u2009=\u20090.643). Lower quality scores were associated \nwith higher engagement (\u03b2 -0.59, P\u2009=\u20090.012) and higher \nengagement rate (\u03b2 -0.57, P\u2009=\u20090.016), although these dif-\nferences were small.

Results indicate \nFig.\u202f1\u2002 Flow chart of\u00a0sample selection process\nPage 8 of 14\nDenniss\u00a0et\u00a0al. Int J Behav Nutr Phys Act           (2024) 21:16 \nthat most information posted by Australian accounts is of \nlow to moderate quality and almost half of posts contain \ninaccuracies. Information about supplements or posted \nby brand accounts tended to be of lower quality and \naccuracy compared to other topics and authors of infor-\nmation. Australian nutritionist and dietitian accounts \nposted higher quality information that was more likely to \nbe accurate.\nOverall, the quality and accuracy of nutrition-related \nInstagram posts included in this study was poor and \nposts that were of lower quality received higher engage-\nment. These findings are consistent with content analyses \nof nutrition-related information from YouTube, [48\u201351] \nInstagram, [36] WhatsApp, [52] Twitter, [53] Facebook, \n[54] and blogs, [55] which found large proportions of \ninaccurate and poor quality information. Furthermore, a \nstudy on YouTube videos about nutrition following bari-\natric surgery found that poor quality and inaccurate vid-\neos were the most popular [50]. Conversely, studies about \nhealthy eating information on blogs [56] and information \nabout food safety and eating for coeliac disease on You-\nTube [57, 58] have found information to be accurate and \nof fair to high quality. More broadly, studies about health-\nrelated information on social media have found that \nhealth misinformation is abundant on social media plat-\nforms and is often more popular than factual information \n[31]. A small association between information accuracy \nand quality was observed, which is consistent with previ-\nous research that has seen a very weak correlation [59] \nor no correlation [60] between the quality and accuracy \nof nutrition-related information. Findings from this study \nand the health and nutrition communication literature \nsuggest that Instagram and other social media users are \nlikely to be exposed to suboptimal and misleading nutri-\ntion information. Furthermore, over a third of posts in \nthis study contained a combination of accurate and inac-\ncurate information, which may make it difficult for con-\nsumers to identify accurate information when engaging \nwith nutrition-related posts by Australian accounts. The \ngenerally low PRHISM scores that Australian accounts \nreceived suggest that consumers may be presented with \ninformation that is difficult to understand and lacks suf-\nficient context or evidence, which may undermine public \nhealth nutrition efforts and contribute to confusion and \nbacklash [34, 35].\nInformation about supplements and information \nposted by brand accounts was of the lowest quality and \naccuracy consistent with existing research. A systematic \nreview of the quality and accuracy of online nutrition \ninformation found that information published by com-\nmercial entities was often of the lowest quality and accu-\nracy, however, this finding was not consistent throughout \nthe included studies and there was variation in which \npublishers provided the most reliable information [25]. \nThe same review also found that information about sup-\nplements was typically inaccurate and of low quality [25]. \nSimilarly, Basch et\u00a0al. found that YouTube videos about \nmultivitamin supplements were of poor quality, [49] and \na small analysis of Instagram posts containing #immune-\nbooster found numerous inaccurate claims about the \nimmune boosting benefits of supplements during the \nCOVID-19 pandemic [61]. Marketing from brands and \ninfluencers dominates social media and the marketing of \nsupplements is prevalent on Instagram [4, 7]. The inac-\ncurate and poor-quality information about supplements \nand posted by Australian brand accounts observed in \nthis study may indicate that exaggerated information may \nbe used as a marketing tactic on Instagram. While con-\nsumers should be critical of nutrition information pro-\nvided by commercial entities or alongside the marketing \nTable\u202f3\u2002 Characteristics of Instagram accounts (n\u2009=\u200947) and Instagram posts (n\u2009=\u2009676) included in total sample\nInstagram \naccount \ncategory (n)\nTotal posts \nin sample \nn (%)\nFollowers \n(mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard \ndeviation)\nPost topic n (%)\nWeight loss Sports/\nexercise \nnutrition\nSupplements\nFoods/\nnutrients & \nhealth\nGeneral \nhealthy \neating\nPaediatric \nnutrition\nOther\nAll (47)\n676 (100)\n271,789\u2009\u00b1\u2009293,101\n91 (13.5)\n45 (6.7)\n246 (36.4)\n116 (17.2)\n108 (16.0)\n33 (4.9)\n37 (5.5)\nBy account category\n\u2003 Brand (22)\n328 (48.5)\n230,188\u2009\u00b1\u200996,768\n33 (10.1)\n5 (1.5)\n208 (63.4)\n50 (15.2)\n26 (7.9)\n0 (0)\n7 (2.1)\n\u2003 \u2003 Fitness/\ncoaching \ninfluencer (9)\n146 (21.6)\n448,946\u2009\u00b1\u2009626,286\n46 (31.5)\n39 (26.7)\n23 (15.8)\n12 (8.2)\n23 (15.8)\n0 (0)\n3 (2.1)\n\u2003 Lifestyle \ninfluencer (8)\n57 (8.4)\n285,787\u2009\u00b1\u2009152,421\n3 (5.3)\n0 (0)\n11 (19.3)\n18 (31.6)\n19 (33.3)\n0 (0)\n6 (10.5)\n\u2003 Nutrition-\nist/dietitian \ninfluencer (8)\n145 (21.4)\n172,888\u2009\u00b1\u200988,051\n9 (6.2)\n1 (0.7)\n4 (2.8)\n36 (24.8)\n41 (28.3)\n33 (22.8)\n21 (14.5)\nPage 9 of 14\nDenniss\u00a0et\u00a0al.

In 2022, \nan Australian supplement company with a large social \nmedia presence was fined $26,640 AUD by the Therapeu-\ntic Goods Administration for unlawful claims about their \nsupplements and cancer and Alzheimer\u2019s prevention [62]. \nMore frequent and severe prosecution for misleading \ninformation may help disincentivise commercial entities \nfrom making false claims.\nIn this study posts by Australian nutritionists and \ndietitians generally received higher quality and accuracy \nscores than posts by other accounts. This is consistent \nwith results from a recent analysis of nutrition-related \nInstagram content, where posts categorised as \u201cnutrition \nand dietetics\u201d received higher quality evaluations com-\npared to other categories such as \u201cfitness\u201d and \u201cmotiva-\ntion\u201d [36]. Furthermore, previous accuracy evaluations of \nwebsite content authored by registered dietitians versus \nnutritionists found that dietitians provided more accu-\nrate information in two studies based in Canada and the \nUnited States, where the title \u201cnutritionist\u201d is not regu-\nlated [63, 64] However, contrasting results were observed \nin an international analysis of tweets by dietitians, which \nfound that 58% of tweets were not evidence based [53].\nAlthough information posted by Australian nutrition-\nists and dietitians was of the highest quality and accu-\nracy in this study, no posts were classified as excellent \nquality and inaccuracies were detected in over a quarter \nof their posts. In recent years, the public\u2019s trust in nutri-\ntion science has generally eroded [65, 66]. Factors such \nas scientific uncertainty, conflicts of interest \u2013 both real \nand perceived, and insufficient context and contradictory \nmessaging in nutrition communication have diminished \nthe public\u2019s trust in credible and authoritative voices in \nnutrition science.[65, 66] It is important for nutrition \nexperts to post high-quality and accurate information \nto prevent the worsening of mistrust in nutrition sci-\nence. The quality scores observed may reflect the higher \nengagement received by posts that were lower in quality \nand nutrition professionals may be developing content \nthat conforms with what is popular on social media to \nincrease their reach and engagement. Regardless, Aus-\ntralian nutritionists and dietitians should improve the \nquality of their posts by including references, referring \nreaders to relevant health professionals, and ensuring \ninformation is accessible, avoids jargon and is written at \nan appropriate reading level [30, 67]. In this study it was \nrare for nutrition professionals to adequately describe \ntheir qualifications in their Instagram bios. Providing \nmore information about education and accreditation \nmay improve the quality of nutrition professionals\u2019 health \ncommunication and indicate their expertise to consum-\ners [30]. However, increasing transparency regarding \nqualifications may not result in increased uptake of nutri-\ntion advice from credentialed experts, given the public\u2019s \ndiminished trust in the field.\nThis study had a number of key strengths. Use of the \nPRHISM tool to evaluate information quality is a strength \nas it was designed for social media content and measures \naspects of information quality that are unique to social \nmedia [43]. Typically, studies evaluating the quality of \nhealth or nutrition-related social media content have \nused tools developed for different contexts, which may \nnot be appropriate for social media [25]. All posts were \nscreened by two researchers and a random 10% of posts \nwere evaluated twice for reliability. Furthermore, this \nstudy included a large sample of posts collected over a \n12-month period, which may improve the generalisability \nof results. There are also limitations to consider. Firstly, a \nportion of posts were coded as \u201cnot assessable\u201d because \nthe information in the post was not contained in the \nresources used to review accuracy. As such, the amount \nof inaccurate information may have been underestimated \nbecause only common nutrition myths were contained \nin the resources and less common inaccuracies were not. \nSecondly, agreement on reliability measures for quality \nand accuracy evaluations was moderate. However, pro-\ntocols were improved based on common disagreements \nand the remainder of evaluations were done by one \nauthor to improve consistency. Thirdly, it is not possible \nto determine the influence of bots on follower counts or \nTable\u202f5\u2002 Quality scores for nutrition-related Instagram posts by \nprinciple of the PRHISM tool and overall score\nEach principle in PRHISM is scored from 0 to 4, where a higher score indicates \nhigher quality.

This is because \nbots are difficult to detect and Instagram restricts access \nto their application programming interface (API), mean-\ning that much of Instagram\u2019s data cannot be accessed or \nsystematically searched. However, limited access to APIs \nand the influence of algorithms and bots are common \nlimitations in social media research. Fourthly, the Insta-\ngram data used in this study was sourced from Australian \nInstagram accounts and may therefore not be generalis-\nable to nutrition-related Instagram content published in \ndifferent geographical locations. Finally, Reels and other \nvideo content was not included in this study because it \nwas not feasible to transcribe video content for analy-\nsis. Reels have grown in popularity since the data was \ncollected [68] and future research should investigate \nthe quality and accuracy of nutrition-related Instagram \nReels.\nFindings from this content analysis have implications \nfor policy, practice, and future research. In Australia \nregulatory bodies have handed down fines for mislead-\ning claims, [62] prohibited influencer marketing of \ntherapeutic goods, such as supplements, [69] and put \na call out to social media users to report influencers \nwho do not disclose brand partnerships [70]. These are \npromising steps toward curbing unreliable health and \nnutrition misinformation. However, regulatory bodies \nand the public should not bear all responsibility and \ndo not have sufficient resources for comprehensive \nsurveillance and monitoring of social media and the \nfindings from this study highlight the failure of cur-\nrent public health measures to adequately tackle this \nissue in Australia. Social media companies should do \nmore to regulate content on their platforms, which is \nstrongly recommended by the World Health Organiza-\ntion [71]. For example, social media platforms could \nverify the qualifications of health professionals and \nintroduce features that enable content creators to \neasily include references in posts and refer individu-\nals to local health organisations to improve credible \ncommunication that aligns with PRHISM and World \nHealth Organization recommendations [30, 71]. Fur-\nthermore, the current system that social media, food, \nwellness and supplement companies operate within, \nprioritises profit over human and planetary health \nand is acknowledged within commercial determinants \nof health framework [72]. A substantial reorientation \nof this system to prioritise health over profit may be \nmore effective for preventing health misinformation \nthan reprimanding individual influencers or brands \nfor misleading consumers. Nutrition experts also \nhave a role to play and should ensure that the con-\ntent they publish on social media is accurate and of a \nhigh quality. Support for nutritionists, dietitians, and \nother experts can be provided by professional bod-\nies and institutions to embed media and communica-\ntions training within tertiary education and continuing \nprofessional development. Nutrition communication \nhas been outlined as a priority area in the Australian \nNational Committee for Nutrition decadal plan for \nthe science of nutrition, highlighting the importance \nof communication to the field of nutrition [73]. Future \nresearch should characterise who is exposed to nutri-\ntion misinformation, and who engages with, shares \nand believes misinformation. Additionally, more work \nis needed to understand how nutrition misinforma-\ntion may be influencing the dietary choices consum-\ners are making. Further analysis by topic may also yield \nhelpful insights. Considering the importance of infant \nnutrition, the paediatric topic area could be a signifi-\ncant are to focus future efforts. Finally, research is \nneeded to develop methods of measuring health mis-\ninformation\u2019s severity and potential for harm so that \npotential impacts can be estimated.\nConclusion\nThis content analysis found that a large proportion of \nnutrition-related information posted by influential Aus-\ntralian Instagram accounts is of suboptimal quality and \naccuracy. Instagram users who follow and engage with \nnutrition-related Instagram content posted by Austral-\nian influencers and brands may be at risk of being mis-\ninformed. Information about supplements and content \nposted by brand accounts was more likely to contain \ninaccuracies and be of lower quality. Posts by dieti-\ntians and nutritionists were higher in quality and more \nlikely to be accurate. The public should be sceptical of \nthe credibility of nutrition-related Instagram content \nthat includes marketing and seek out information pro-\nvided by nutritionists and dietitians over other entities \non Instagram. Although information posted by Austral-\nian dietitians and nutritionists was of the highest qual-\nity and accuracy, there is scope for improvement and \nnutrition experts should prioritise providing credible \nand reliable nutrition communication on social media.\nAbbreviations\nADG\t\n\u0007Australian Dietary Guidelines\nNRV\t\n\u0007Nutrient Reference Values\nPEN\t\n\u0007Practice-based Evidence in Nutrition\nPRHISM\t\n\u0007Principles for Health-related Information on Social Media\nSTROBE\t\n\u0007Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology\nPage 12 of 14\nDenniss\u00a0et\u00a0al.

Int J Behav Nutr Phys Act           (2024) 21:16 \nIntroduction\nPoor diet quality is the leading preventable risk factor \ncontributing to the global burden of non-communica-\nble disease [1]. Dietary behaviours are complex and are \ninfluenced by a range of factors, including hunger, taste \npreferences, food availability, price, societal norms, and \npolicy context [2]. Nutrition information environments, \nwhich encompass the media and advertising, can also \nexert an influence on dietary behaviours [2]. Social media \nhas recently become a prominent part of the modern \nmedia environment and is a popular vehicle for advertis-\ning, marketing and information sharing. Fifty-nine per-\ncent of the global population are active on social media, \n[3] and social media advertising revenue was projected to \nreach $173 billion USD in 2022 [4]. Food and nutrition \nare popular topics on social media platforms, [5, 6] and \nmarketing of food and supplement products has become \nprolific [7, 8]. There is a growing body of evidence that \nindicates food and nutrition content and marketing \non social media has the power to influence food choice \n[9\u201312].\nAs the Internet has become more accessible, individu-\nals have increasingly utilised it to source information \nabout nutrition. Consumers seek nutrition information \nfor various reasons including health management, curi-\nosity, and interest\u00a0 [13]. Nutrition information is con-\ntent that provides the general public with guidance on \nsourcing, storing, preparing and consuming food to sup-\nport good health, and includes recipes, product details, \nhealthy-eating advice and nutritional requirements \n(defined in full in Table\u00a01). Increases in online nutrition \ninformation seeking behaviour have been observed in \nAmerica, [14] Canada, [15] France, [16] and Norway, [17] \nand the Internet is the primary source of nutrition infor-\nmation for Australians [18, 19]. Social media has become \na ubiquitous part of the Internet and consumers search \nfor and follow food and nutrition-related content on \nsocial media [6, 20\u201322]. A survey of American Instagram \nusers found that 87% of female users followed nutrition-\nrelated content on the platform [6]. Consumers not only \nseek information about food and nutrition on social \nmedia they are also passively exposed to it in their social \nmedia feeds without intentionally searching for it [23, \n24]. Due to the influence of social media algorithms and \npaid sponsorships, social media users are also presented \nwith content in their feed from entities that they do not \nfollow. Furthermore, content can be published by anyone, \nregardless of their qualifications, level of expertise in the \ntopic or conflicting interests.\nAccurate and high-quality information is essential \nfor effective health communication and promotion. In \nhealth communication literature, accuracy refers to \nhealth information\u2019s factual correctness, and quality \nrefers to information\u2019s reliability when assessed using \ndefined quality criteria (see Table\u00a0 1) [25, 26]. Quality \nand accuracy are two important but distinct compo-\nnents of information\u2019s overall reliability. It is possible \nfor information to be accurate but of low quality and \nvice versa. Previous studies have assessed the accu-\nracy of online nutrition information against authorita-\ntive sources such as dietary guidelines, authoritative \nreports and peer reviewed literature [25]. Numerous \nquality assessment tools have been used to evaluate \nthe quality of online nutrition information, such as the \nDISCERN Instrument, [27]. Journal of the American \nMedical Association Benchmarks, [28] and Health on \nthe Net Code Principles [7, 29]. These tools share com-\nmon quality criteria, such as, declaring financial inter-\nests, citing sources, authorship by an individual with \nrelevant health-related qualifications, and disclosure of \nthe author\u2019s qualifications. Principles for Health-related \nInformation on Social Media (PRHISM), is a recently \ndeveloped quality assessment tool, which includes \nthese established quality principles and additional \nprinciples that are relevant to social media, including \naccessibility and readability [30]. There is a broad con-\nsensus in the literature that health information of sub-\noptimal quality and accuracy is extremely prevalent on \nsocial media [26, 31]. Concerningly, misinformation is \noften more popular than truthful information, receives \nhigher user engagement and spreads more quickly than \nthe truth due to its novelty [31, 32]. Furthermore, the \nnarrative of health misinformation often includes and \npromotes mistrust in authoritative institutions and \nTable\u202f1\u2002 Key definitions\na From Denniss et\u00a0al. [25]\nAccuracy: The factual correctness of\u00a0information when\u00a0compared to\u00a0authoritative sources of\u00a0information such as\u00a0systematic reviews, meta analyses \nor\u00a0national dietary guidelines [25].\nQuality: The reliability of\u00a0information as\u00a0assessed by\u00a0quality criteria [26]. Quality criteria typically include components such as\u00a0readability, inclusion of\u00a0ref-\nerences, transparency about\u00a0financial interests and\u00a0disclosure of\u00a0the\u00a0author\u2019s identity and\u00a0qualifications\naNutrition-related information: information regarding\u00a0healthy eating, dietary patterns, nutrients, nutritional requirements, nutritional composition \nof\u00a0foods, nutritional supplements, health outcomes associated with\u00a0foods and\u00a0dietary patterns, food safety, food ethics, cooking and\u00a0recipes intended \nfor\u00a0the\u00a0general public [25].\nPage 3 of 14\nDenniss\u00a0et\u00a0al. Int J Behav Nutr Phys Act           (2024) 21:16 \n\t\nexperts [31]. Social media-based misinformation can \nhave consequences for public health, for example, the \nonline anti-vaccination movement is believed to have \ncontributed to a reduction in vaccination rates and the \nreemergence of previously eradicated communicable \ndiseases [31, 33].\nPublic health nutrition experts and organisations have \nraised concerns about the potential for nutrition-related \nmisinformation to cause serious harm and undermine \ncredible nutrition communication. Exposure to nutri-\ntion information that lacks context or contradicts previ-\nous messaging can lead to confusion and backlash, which \nhas been evidenced to reduce consumers\u2019 willingness \nto engage in healthful behaviours and accept advice by \nauthoritative nutrition experts [34, 35]. If dietary behav-\niours are based on misinformation that contradicts evi-\ndence-based dietary guidelines, it may put individuals at \ngreater risk of developing non-communicable diseases \nthat are associated with unhealthy dietary patterns [1]. A \nrecent systematic review of studies evaluating the quality \nand accuracy of nutrition-related information published \non websites and social media found that generally infor-\nmation was of suboptimal quality and accuracy [25]. A \nsmall number of studies in the review investigated cer-\ntain social media (e.g., blogs, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter \nand WhatsApp), meaning other platforms, such as Insta-\ngram have had limited attention [25]. A further limitation \nwas that quality assessment tools designed for different \nsettings, for example, websites, were used to evaluate the \nsocial media content [25]. Furthermore, it was also rare \nfor studies to involve multiple researchers when screen-\ning posts to evaluate, which is a potential source of bias \n[25]. One recent study that was not captured within the \ndate-range of the systematic review examined the qual-\nity of nutrition-related information on Instagram find-\ning that quality was extremely low [36]. However, this \nstudy measured quality as a single criterion, rather than \nusing an extensive quality assessment method, and thus \nmay not have comprehensively measured the quality of \ninformation.\nTo the knowledge of the authors, thus far no studies \nhave assessed the accuracy of nutrition information on \nInstagram, and none have used social media specific tools \nto evaluate the quality of nutrition-related Instagram \ncontent. Instagram was the third most popular social \nmedia platform in Australia, and the fifth most visited \nwebsite in the world in 2021, [3,\u00a037] and nutrition is one \nof the most frequently discussed health topics on Insta-\ngram [5]. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evalu-\nate the quality and accuracy of nutrition information \nposted by popular Australian Instagram accounts using \nthe PRHISM tool to assess quality. A secondary aim was \nto examine trends in information quality and accuracy by \nauthor, topic, post engagement, account verification and \nnumber of followers.\nMethods\nStudy design and\u00a0data collection\nThe present study involved a cross-sectional evaluation \nof the quality and accuracy of nutrition-related infor-\nmation published on Instagram by Australian influencer \nor brand accounts. The Strengthening the Reporting of \nObservational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guide-\nlines were followed and the checklist is available in Sup-\nplementary Table\u00a01 [38]. A subsample of Instagram posts \ncollected for a wider project formed the dataset for this \nstudy and data collection has been described in detail \nelsewhere [7]. Briefly, a list of the top 1,000 Australian \nhealth Instagram accounts as of April 2021 was screened \nto determine eligibility [39]. Australian accounts with \nover 100,000 followers, a minimum of 100 posts, their \nmost recent post published within two weeks, and a \nminimum of 25% of their content relating to nutrition \nwere included. The figure of 100,000 followers was cho-\nsen because accounts with over 100,000 followers are \nconsidered to be macro influencers or above (over one \nmillion followers is considered to be a mega influencer) \n[40]. Social media users tend to trust the influencers and \nbrands that they follow, [41] and the purpose of this study \nwas to capture information posted by popular Austral-\nian Instagram accounts, therefore, only accounts with \ngreater than 100,000 followers were considered eligible \nfor inclusion. Accounts appearing under the \u201csuggested\u201d \ntab on the Instagram page of included accounts were \nalso screened. Screening was done between May and July \n2021 using an Instagram account made specifically for \nthe project and using Google Chrome\u2019s incognito mode \nto minimise the impact of the algorithm on the sug-\ngested accounts. Two researchers (ED and JV, named in \nacknowledgements) independently screened all accounts \nand disagreements were discussed until agreement was \nreached.\nAll posts by eligible accounts from a twelve-month \nperiod (September 2020 \u2013 September 2021) were down-\nloaded through a paid subscription to Keyhole, an online \nsocial media analytics tool. The data extracted through \nKeyhole included each post\u2019s text-based caption, engage-\nment (sum of likes and comments), the date of upload \nand each account\u2019s bio, number of followers and if it \nwas verified with a blue tick. Each post was manually \nscreened for relevance. Video content including Reels \nand posts that did not refer to one or more component \nof nutrition-related information, as defined in Table\u00a0 1, \nwere excluded. Ten percent of posts were screened inde-\npendently by the lead author (ED) and a research assis-\ntant (JV) for relevance to nutrition information, with 94% \nPage 4 of 14\nDenniss\u00a0et\u00a0al. Int J Behav Nutr Phys Act           (2024) 21:16 \nagreement. The screening resulted in a sample of 10,964 \nInstagram posts containing nutrition-related informa-\ntion, which have been characterised in a previous content \nanalysis study [7].\nFor this study, a random stratified (by Instagram \naccount) subsample of the 10,964 posts were selected and \nscreened further for eligibility. A total of 2,025 posts were \nrandomly selected to be screened (up to 35 posts from \neach of the included Instagram accounts). The random \nsubsample for screening was selected using the sample \nfunction in Stata in March 2022. Posts that promoted a \nproduct but did not include any information about the \nhealth benefits of the product, for example, promotion of \na supplement without mention of its benefits, and posts \nthat only included recipes or meal ideas and no additional \ninformation were excluded because these posts did not \nprovide nutrition guidance that could be evaluated for \naccuracy or quality. All other posts were deemed eligible. \nScreening was done independently by two researchers \n(all posts screened by ED and with secondary screening \nby SM, LM or research assistant JL). Disagreements were \ndiscussed by the two researchers responsible for screen-\ning the relevant post until consensus was reached.\nQuality and\u00a0accuracy evaluations\nThe quality of information was evaluated using the \nPRHISM tool [30]. PRHISM was developed as a tool to \nevaluate the quality of social media-based information \nabout any health-related topic and considers the unique \ncharacteristics of social media content, for example, \ncovert advertising and brevity of information. To the \nknowledge of the authors, PRHISM is the only qual-\nity assessment tool that has been specifically developed \nfor health information delivered via social media. Other \ntools for evaluating the quality of health-related informa-\ntion exist. However, these tools were developed for dif-\nferent settings, such as websites or patient information \npamphlets and their use to evaluate health-related social \nmedia content has been scrutinised in the literature [25, \n42, 43]. PRHISM was developed in a Delphi study, which \ninvolved a panel of 18 expert participants [30]. The par-\nticipants were experts in health communication or a \nhealth-related field, used social media to communicate \nabout health and worked in academia, public health, \ncommunications and/or as health professionals. Three \nDelphi surveys were undertaken to determine group con-\nsensus about the principles to include in PRHISM. Prin-\nciples were based on quality criteria from previous tools \nand adapted to suit social media or were new principles \nsuggested by the expert panel. After the third Delphi sur-\nvey, a draft of the PRHISM scoring tool and guide for use \nwas circulated to participants for feedback about face \nvalidity and participants agreed with the final wording of \nthe principles and guide [30].\nPRHISM consists of thirteen principles that are scored \nfrom zero to four [30]. A number of principles may not \nbe relevant to evaluate depending on the nature of the \nsocial media post being evaluated, for example, principle \n8 relates to privacy and is only relevant to evaluate if the \npost discusses a client or patient. The overall PRHISM \nscore is weighted proportionately as a percentage of the \ntotal available score, whereby principles that are deemed \nnot relevant do not contribute to the total available score. \nThe overall PRHISM score ranges from 0 \u2013 100 where a \nhigher score indicates higher quality. A score of zero to \n25 is considered poor, 26\u2013 50 mediocre, 51 \u2013 75 good \nand 76 \u2013 100 excellent quality [30]. All images and infor-\nmation contained within the post, information in the \naccount holder\u2019s bio and information contained in links \nprovided within the post or bio were considered in qual-\nity evaluations, as outlined in the PRHISM protocol [30]. \nA summary of the PRHISM assessment principles is \nincluded in Table\u00a02.\nTo determine accuracy, the information contained in \nthe Instagram posts was evaluated against information \ncontained in the Australian Dietary Guidelines (ADG) \n[44] Nutrient Reference Values (NRVs), Practice-based \nEvidence in Nutrition Global Resource for Nutrition \nPractice (PEN), [45] and/or Metafact fact-checking plat-\nform. [46] Metafact is a website that enables the public \nto ask questions, which are answered by verified PhDs, \nresearchers and medical specialists.[46] Multiple experts \ncan answer the questions and if\u2009\u2265\u200970% of verified experts \nagree on an answer, it is deemed that consensus has \nbeen achieved [46]. Only questions with consensus were \nused for accuracy evaluations. A large number of posts \nwithin the sample contained claims about the benefits of \ncollagen supplementation for skin health, however, rel-\nevant information was not contained within the chosen \nauthoritative resources. Therefore, a recent systematic \nreview about collagen supplementation was also used to \ndetermine the accuracy of claims about collagen and skin \nhealth [47]. An accuracy coding framework was devel-\noped and was informed by a systematic review of the \nquality and accuracy of online nutrition information [25]. \nPosts were coded as containing information that is com-\npletely inaccurate (0), mostly inaccurate with some accu-\nracies (1), mostly accurate with some inaccuracies (2), \ncompletely accurate (3) or not assessable (4) (see Table\u20092 \nfor descriptions of accuracy categories). All the nutrition \ninformation within a post was considered when evaluat-\ning accuracy. If posts contained information about nutri-\ntion and other topics, such as sleep or exercise, only the \ninformation about nutrition was evaluated. Some posts \ncontained claims about the health benefits of specific \nPage 5 of 14\nDenniss\u00a0et\u00a0al. Int J Behav Nutr Phys Act           (2024) 21:16 \n\t\nproducts, such as supplements, but did not contain suffi-\ncient information about the nutrients or ingredients con-\ntained in the product for an assessment to be made. In \nthese instances, additional information about the prod-\nuct was sourced from its website in order to evaluate the \naccuracy of the claims.\nAssessments were conducted and recorded in a pur-\npose-designed REDCap database. A set of coding rules \nwas developed to ensure that information that appeared \nmultiple times in the sample of posts was coded consist-\nently for accuracy. Before completing the quality and \naccuracy evaluations, a random 10% if the sample was \nevaluated independently by two authors (ED and LM) for \ninter-rater reliability, achieving 79% agreement for quality \ncategory and 85% for accuracy score. Disagreements \nregarding quality or accuracy evaluations were discussed \nby ED and LM until consensus was reached. Common \nreasons for disagreement were discussed and relevant \nupdates to the study protocol were made before the \nremaining evaluations were completed to improve rigor. \nED conducted the quality and accuracy assessments for \nthe remainder of the sample to further improve consist-\nency. Posts containing information that was difficult to \nevaluate were discussed before reaching a decision. Ins-\ntagram accounts and the topic of Instagram posts were \ninductively categorised.

Int J Behav Nutr Phys Act           (2024) 21:16 \nafter screening had concluded and both researchers were \nimmersed in the data. Each included account was inde-\npendently categorised, and disagreements were discussed \nby ED and JV until agreement was reached. The catego-\nries for Instagram accounts were used in the preceding \nstudy for which the data was originally collected [7]. \nCategories for post topic were developed during the reli-\nability assessments based on the most frequent nutrition-\nrelated topics mentioned in the posts and all posts were \ncategorised by the first author. Descriptions of account \nand topic categories are summarised in Supplementary \nTable\u00a02.\nStatistical analysis\nData was exported from REDCap and statistical analyses \nwere performed in Stata/SE v17.0 (StataCorp, College \nStation, TX). Descriptive statistics were run. Multilevel \nmixed-effects models were used to estimate quality \nscores for account categories, post topics, account veri-\nfication, accuracy score, follower count, engagement, \nand engagement rate. Marginal means of quality scores \nfor account categories and post topics were calculated. \nPairwise comparisons were run to determine mean dif-\nferences in quality scores across account categories, post \ntopics and accuracy categories. Mixed-effects ordered \nlogistic regression models were used to estimate accu-\nracy score outcomes for account categories, post top-\nics, account verification, follower count, engagement \nand engagement rate. Pairwise comparisons were run \nto determine mean differences in quality scores across \naccount categories and post topics. Mixed-effects models \nwere chosen to account for the structure of the data, with \nthe possibility of repeat measures (i.e., multiple posts) \nfor each Instagram account, with posts being the unit \nof analysis and the models including random intercepts \nfor Instagram accounts. Quality and accuracy scores \nwere treated as the dependent variable. Engagement and \nengagement rate had positively skewed distributions and \nwere log transformed. One account had an outlying num-\nber of followers (>\u20092,000,000) and was thus removed from \nanalyses involving follower counts. After removing the \noutlying account, follower counts remained skewed and \nwere also log transformed to achieve normal distribution. \nAnalysis was run with and without the outlying account \nshowing little difference to the result (data not shown). \nStatistical significance was set at P\u2009<\u20090.05.\nEthics\nThe Instagram posts included in this study were pub-\nlicly available. Due to the public nature of the data, this \nstudy was exempt from formal review by an ethics com-\nmittee. To ensure that this study upholds ethical research \nstandards, no identifying information about the account-\nholders has been published.\nResults\nA total of 676 posts from 47 accounts were included in \nthe final sample (Fig.\u00a01, Table\u00a03). Accounts had an aver-\nage of 314,817 followers. The most common topic dis-\ncussed in posts was supplements (36.4%) followed by \nfoods/nutrients and health (17.2%), general healthy eat-\ning (16.0%), weight loss (13.5%), sports/exercise nutrition \n(6.7%), other (5.5%) and paediatric nutrition (4.9%).\nQuality\nOverall, 34.8% (n\u2009=\u2009235) of posts were classified as poor, \n59.2% (n\u2009=\u2009400) mediocre, 6.1% (n\u2009=\u200941) good and zero \nposts were classified as excellent quality. The mean \nPRHISM score was mediocre (31.8\u2009\u00b1\u200910.3 out of a pos-\nsible score of 100) and scores varied across principles \n(Table\u00a0 4). Only two principles had a mean score above \ntwo (4. Financial disclosure and 13. Images) (Table\u00a0 5). \nPosts authored by accounts in the nutritionist/dietitian \ninfluencer account category were associated with higher \nquality scores compared to the reference group (brands) \n(\u03b2, 17.8, CI 13.94\u201321.65; P\u2009<\u20090.001) and all other account \ncategories. Posts that contained information about foods/\nnutrients and health or general healthy eating were \nassociated with higher quality scores compared to the \nreference group (weight loss information) and posts con-\ntaining information about supplements. There was no \nassociation between information quality and accounts \nbeing verified (\u03b2 0.572, P\u2009=\u20090.821) or follower count (\u03b2 \n-1.18, P\u2009=\u20090.643). Lower quality scores were associated \nwith higher engagement (\u03b2 -0.59, P\u2009=\u20090.012) and higher \nengagement rate (\u03b2 -0.57, P\u2009=\u20090.016), although these dif-\nferences were small. A complete summary of the results \nfrom the mixed effects analysis of quality scores by \naccount type and post topic is provided in Supplemen-\ntary Table\u00a03 and 4.\nAccuracy\nFrom the 676 posts included in the sample, 166 were not \nassessable and a total of 510 posts were evaluated for \naccuracy (see Fig.\u00a0 1). Of the posts that were evaluated \nfor accuracy, 44.7% (n\u2009=\u2009228) of posts contained inac-\ncuracies, 8.6% (n\u2009=\u200944) of posts were completely inac-\ncurate, 14.3% (n\u2009=\u200973) mostly inaccurate, 21.8% (111) \nmostly accurate and 55.3% (n\u2009=\u2009282) completely accurate. \nPosts published by fitness influencers had higher odds of \nreceiving a higher score for accuracy compared to posts \npublished by brands (OR 3.09, CI 1.21\u20137.87, P\u2009=\u20090.018) \nas did posts published by nutritionist/dietitian influencer \naccounts (OR 4.69, CI 1.81\u201312.14, P\u2009=\u20090.001).

There was no difference in odds of receiving a \nhigher accuracy score for posts authored by a verified or \nnon-verified account (OR 2.07, CI 0.87\u20134.94, P\u2009=\u20090.10), \nfollower count (OR 1.12, CI 0.46\u20132.69, P\u2009=\u20090.803), \nengagement (OR 1.02, CI 0.84\u20131.24, P\u2009=\u20090.831) or engage-\nment rate (OR 1.0, CI 0.82\u20131.21, P\u2009=\u20090.960). A complete \nsummary of the results from the mixed effects analysis \nof accuracy scores by account type and post topic is pro-\nvided in Supplementary Table\u00a03 and 4.\nPosts that were completely accurate were associated \nwith higher quality scores compared to posts that were \ncompletely inaccurate (\u03b2 2.24, CI 0.29\u20134.19, P\u2009=\u20090.024). \nHowever, the differences in quality scores between posts \ncontaining completely accurate versus completely inac-\ncurate information was small. There was no difference in \nquality scores observed for posts containing mostly inac-\ncurate or mostly accurate information.\nDiscussion\nThis content analysis study evaluated the quality and \naccuracy of nutrition-related information posted by \npopular Australian Instagram accounts. Results indicate \nFig.\u202f1\u2002 Flow chart of\u00a0sample selection process\nPage 8 of 14\nDenniss\u00a0et\u00a0al. Int J Behav Nutr Phys Act           (2024) 21:16 \nthat most information posted by Australian accounts is of \nlow to moderate quality and almost half of posts contain \ninaccuracies. Information about supplements or posted \nby brand accounts tended to be of lower quality and \naccuracy compared to other topics and authors of infor-\nmation. Australian nutritionist and dietitian accounts \nposted higher quality information that was more likely to \nbe accurate.\nOverall, the quality and accuracy of nutrition-related \nInstagram posts included in this study was poor and \nposts that were of lower quality received higher engage-\nment. These findings are consistent with content analyses \nof nutrition-related information from YouTube, [48\u201351] \nInstagram, [36] WhatsApp, [52] Twitter, [53] Facebook, \n[54] and blogs, [55] which found large proportions of \ninaccurate and poor quality information. Furthermore, a \nstudy on YouTube videos about nutrition following bari-\natric surgery found that poor quality and inaccurate vid-\neos were the most popular [50]. Conversely, studies about \nhealthy eating information on blogs [56] and information \nabout food safety and eating for coeliac disease on You-\nTube [57, 58] have found information to be accurate and \nof fair to high quality. More broadly, studies about health-\nrelated information on social media have found that \nhealth misinformation is abundant on social media plat-\nforms and is often more popular than factual information \n[31]. A small association between information accuracy \nand quality was observed, which is consistent with previ-\nous research that has seen a very weak correlation [59] \nor no correlation [60] between the quality and accuracy \nof nutrition-related information. Findings from this study \nand the health and nutrition communication literature \nsuggest that Instagram and other social media users are \nlikely to be exposed to suboptimal and misleading nutri-\ntion information. Furthermore, over a third of posts in \nthis study contained a combination of accurate and inac-\ncurate information, which may make it difficult for con-\nsumers to identify accurate information when engaging \nwith nutrition-related posts by Australian accounts. The \ngenerally low PRHISM scores that Australian accounts \nreceived suggest that consumers may be presented with \ninformation that is difficult to understand and lacks suf-\nficient context or evidence, which may undermine public \nhealth nutrition efforts and contribute to confusion and \nbacklash [34, 35].\nInformation about supplements and information \nposted by brand accounts was of the lowest quality and \naccuracy consistent with existing research. A systematic \nreview of the quality and accuracy of online nutrition \ninformation found that information published by com-\nmercial entities was often of the lowest quality and accu-\nracy, however, this finding was not consistent throughout \nthe included studies and there was variation in which \npublishers provided the most reliable information [25]. \nThe same review also found that information about sup-\nplements was typically inaccurate and of low quality [25]. \nSimilarly, Basch et\u00a0al. found that YouTube videos about \nmultivitamin supplements were of poor quality, [49] and \na small analysis of Instagram posts containing #immune-\nbooster found numerous inaccurate claims about the \nimmune boosting benefits of supplements during the \nCOVID-19 pandemic [61]. Marketing from brands and \ninfluencers dominates social media and the marketing of \nsupplements is prevalent on Instagram [4, 7]. The inac-\ncurate and poor-quality information about supplements \nand posted by Australian brand accounts observed in \nthis study may indicate that exaggerated information may \nbe used as a marketing tactic on Instagram. While con-\nsumers should be critical of nutrition information pro-\nvided by commercial entities or alongside the marketing \nTable\u202f3\u2002 Characteristics of Instagram accounts (n\u2009=\u200947) and Instagram posts (n\u2009=\u2009676) included in total sample\nInstagram \naccount \ncategory (n)\nTotal posts \nin sample \nn (%)\nFollowers \n(mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard \ndeviation)\nPost topic n (%)\nWeight loss Sports/\nexercise \nnutrition\nSupplements\nFoods/\nnutrients & \nhealth\nGeneral \nhealthy \neating\nPaediatric \nnutrition\nOther\nAll (47)\n676 (100)\n271,789\u2009\u00b1\u2009293,101\n91 (13.5)\n45 (6.7)\n246 (36.4)\n116 (17.2)\n108 (16.0)\n33 (4.9)\n37 (5.5)\nBy account category\n\u2003 Brand (22)\n328 (48.5)\n230,188\u2009\u00b1\u200996,768\n33 (10.1)\n5 (1.5)\n208 (63.4)\n50 (15.2)\n26 (7.9)\n0 (0)\n7 (2.1)\n\u2003 \u2003 Fitness/\ncoaching \ninfluencer (9)\n146 (21.6)\n448,946\u2009\u00b1\u2009626,286\n46 (31.5)\n39 (26.7)\n23 (15.8)\n12 (8.2)\n23 (15.8)\n0 (0)\n3 (2.1)\n\u2003 Lifestyle \ninfluencer (8)\n57 (8.4)\n285,787\u2009\u00b1\u2009152,421\n3 (5.3)\n0 (0)\n11 (19.3)\n18 (31.6)\n19 (33.3)\n0 (0)\n6 (10.5)\n\u2003 Nutrition-\nist/dietitian \ninfluencer (8)\n145 (21.4)\n172,888\u2009\u00b1\u200988,051\n9 (6.2)\n1 (0.7)\n4 (2.8)\n36 (24.8)\n41 (28.3)\n33 (22.8)\n21 (14.5)\nPage 9 of 14\nDenniss\u00a0et\u00a0al.

In 2022, \nan Australian supplement company with a large social \nmedia presence was fined $26,640 AUD by the Therapeu-\ntic Goods Administration for unlawful claims about their \nsupplements and cancer and Alzheimer\u2019s prevention [62]. \nMore frequent and severe prosecution for misleading \ninformation may help disincentivise commercial entities \nfrom making false claims.\nIn this study posts by Australian nutritionists and \ndietitians generally received higher quality and accuracy \nscores than posts by other accounts. This is consistent \nwith results from a recent analysis of nutrition-related \nInstagram content, where posts categorised as \u201cnutrition \nand dietetics\u201d received higher quality evaluations com-\npared to other categories such as \u201cfitness\u201d and \u201cmotiva-\ntion\u201d [36]. Furthermore, previous accuracy evaluations of \nwebsite content authored by registered dietitians versus \nnutritionists found that dietitians provided more accu-\nrate information in two studies based in Canada and the \nUnited States, where the title \u201cnutritionist\u201d is not regu-\nlated [63, 64] However, contrasting results were observed \nin an international analysis of tweets by dietitians, which \nfound that 58% of tweets were not evidence based [53].\nAlthough information posted by Australian nutrition-\nists and dietitians was of the highest quality and accu-\nracy in this study, no posts were classified as excellent \nquality and inaccuracies were detected in over a quarter \nof their posts. In recent years, the public\u2019s trust in nutri-\ntion science has generally eroded [65, 66]. Factors such \nas scientific uncertainty, conflicts of interest \u2013 both real \nand perceived, and insufficient context and contradictory \nmessaging in nutrition communication have diminished \nthe public\u2019s trust in credible and authoritative voices in \nnutrition science.[65, 66] It is important for nutrition \nexperts to post high-quality and accurate information \nto prevent the worsening of mistrust in nutrition sci-\nence. The quality scores observed may reflect the higher \nengagement received by posts that were lower in quality \nand nutrition professionals may be developing content \nthat conforms with what is popular on social media to \nincrease their reach and engagement. Regardless, Aus-\ntralian nutritionists and dietitians should improve the \nquality of their posts by including references, referring \nreaders to relevant health professionals, and ensuring \ninformation is accessible, avoids jargon and is written at \nan appropriate reading level [30, 67]. In this study it was \nrare for nutrition professionals to adequately describe \ntheir qualifications in their Instagram bios. Providing \nmore information about education and accreditation \nmay improve the quality of nutrition professionals\u2019 health \ncommunication and indicate their expertise to consum-\ners [30]. However, increasing transparency regarding \nqualifications may not result in increased uptake of nutri-\ntion advice from credentialed experts, given the public\u2019s \ndiminished trust in the field.\nThis study had a number of key strengths. Use of the \nPRHISM tool to evaluate information quality is a strength \nas it was designed for social media content and measures \naspects of information quality that are unique to social \nmedia [43]. Typically, studies evaluating the quality of \nhealth or nutrition-related social media content have \nused tools developed for different contexts, which may \nnot be appropriate for social media [25]. All posts were \nscreened by two researchers and a random 10% of posts \nwere evaluated twice for reliability. Furthermore, this \nstudy included a large sample of posts collected over a \n12-month period, which may improve the generalisability \nof results. There are also limitations to consider. Firstly, a \nportion of posts were coded as \u201cnot assessable\u201d because \nthe information in the post was not contained in the \nresources used to review accuracy. As such, the amount \nof inaccurate information may have been underestimated \nbecause only common nutrition myths were contained \nin the resources and less common inaccuracies were not. \nSecondly, agreement on reliability measures for quality \nand accuracy evaluations was moderate. However, pro-\ntocols were improved based on common disagreements \nand the remainder of evaluations were done by one \nauthor to improve consistency. Thirdly, it is not possible \nto determine the influence of bots on follower counts or \nTable\u202f5\u2002 Quality scores for nutrition-related Instagram posts by \nprinciple of the PRHISM tool and overall score\nEach principle in PRHISM is scored from 0 to 4, where a higher score indicates \nhigher quality.

Int J Behav Nutr Phys Act           (2024) 21:16 \n\t\nengagement or if the Instagram accounts included in the \nsample was comprehensive of all prominent accounts \nthat post nutrition-related information. This is because \nbots are difficult to detect and Instagram restricts access \nto their application programming interface (API), mean-\ning that much of Instagram\u2019s data cannot be accessed or \nsystematically searched. However, limited access to APIs \nand the influence of algorithms and bots are common \nlimitations in social media research. Fourthly, the Insta-\ngram data used in this study was sourced from Australian \nInstagram accounts and may therefore not be generalis-\nable to nutrition-related Instagram content published in \ndifferent geographical locations. Finally, Reels and other \nvideo content was not included in this study because it \nwas not feasible to transcribe video content for analy-\nsis. Reels have grown in popularity since the data was \ncollected [68] and future research should investigate \nthe quality and accuracy of nutrition-related Instagram \nReels.\nFindings from this content analysis have implications \nfor policy, practice, and future research. In Australia \nregulatory bodies have handed down fines for mislead-\ning claims, [62] prohibited influencer marketing of \ntherapeutic goods, such as supplements, [69] and put \na call out to social media users to report influencers \nwho do not disclose brand partnerships [70]. These are \npromising steps toward curbing unreliable health and \nnutrition misinformation. However, regulatory bodies \nand the public should not bear all responsibility and \ndo not have sufficient resources for comprehensive \nsurveillance and monitoring of social media and the \nfindings from this study highlight the failure of cur-\nrent public health measures to adequately tackle this \nissue in Australia. Social media companies should do \nmore to regulate content on their platforms, which is \nstrongly recommended by the World Health Organiza-\ntion [71]. For example, social media platforms could \nverify the qualifications of health professionals and \nintroduce features that enable content creators to \neasily include references in posts and refer individu-\nals to local health organisations to improve credible \ncommunication that aligns with PRHISM and World \nHealth Organization recommendations [30, 71]. Fur-\nthermore, the current system that social media, food, \nwellness and supplement companies operate within, \nprioritises profit over human and planetary health \nand is acknowledged within commercial determinants \nof health framework [72]. A substantial reorientation \nof this system to prioritise health over profit may be \nmore effective for preventing health misinformation \nthan reprimanding individual influencers or brands \nfor misleading consumers. Nutrition experts also \nhave a role to play and should ensure that the con-\ntent they publish on social media is accurate and of a \nhigh quality. Support for nutritionists, dietitians, and \nother experts can be provided by professional bod-\nies and institutions to embed media and communica-\ntions training within tertiary education and continuing \nprofessional development. Nutrition communication \nhas been outlined as a priority area in the Australian \nNational Committee for Nutrition decadal plan for \nthe science of nutrition, highlighting the importance \nof communication to the field of nutrition [73]. Future \nresearch should characterise who is exposed to nutri-\ntion misinformation, and who engages with, shares \nand believes misinformation. Additionally, more work \nis needed to understand how nutrition misinforma-\ntion may be influencing the dietary choices consum-\ners are making. Further analysis by topic may also yield \nhelpful insights. Considering the importance of infant \nnutrition, the paediatric topic area could be a signifi-\ncant are to focus future efforts. Finally, research is \nneeded to develop methods of measuring health mis-\ninformation\u2019s severity and potential for harm so that \npotential impacts can be estimated.\nConclusion\nThis content analysis found that a large proportion of \nnutrition-related information posted by influential Aus-\ntralian Instagram accounts is of suboptimal quality and \naccuracy. Instagram users who follow and engage with \nnutrition-related Instagram content posted by Austral-\nian influencers and brands may be at risk of being mis-\ninformed. Information about supplements and content \nposted by brand accounts was more likely to contain \ninaccuracies and be of lower quality. Posts by dieti-\ntians and nutritionists were higher in quality and more \nlikely to be accurate. The public should be sceptical of \nthe credibility of nutrition-related Instagram content \nthat includes marketing and seek out information pro-\nvided by nutritionists and dietitians over other entities \non Instagram. Although information posted by Austral-\nian dietitians and nutritionists was of the highest qual-\nity and accuracy, there is scope for improvement and \nnutrition experts should prioritise providing credible \nand reliable nutrition communication on social media.\nAbbreviations\nADG\t\n\u0007Australian Dietary Guidelines\nNRV\t\n\u0007Nutrient Reference Values\nPEN\t\n\u0007Practice-based Evidence in Nutrition\nPRHISM\t\n\u0007Principles for Health-related Information on Social Media\nSTROBE\t\n\u0007Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology\nPage 12 of 14\nDenniss\u00a0et\u00a0al.

Int J Behav Nutr Phys Act           (2024) 21:16 \nIntroduction\nPoor diet quality is the leading preventable risk factor \ncontributing to the global burden of non-communica-\nble disease [1]. Dietary behaviours are complex and are \ninfluenced by a range of factors, including hunger, taste \npreferences, food availability, price, societal norms, and \npolicy context [2]. Nutrition information environments, \nwhich encompass the media and advertising, can also \nexert an influence on dietary behaviours [2]. Social media \nhas recently become a prominent part of the modern \nmedia environment and is a popular vehicle for advertis-\ning, marketing and information sharing. Fifty-nine per-\ncent of the global population are active on social media, \n[3] and social media advertising revenue was projected to \nreach $173 billion USD in 2022 [4]. Food and nutrition \nare popular topics on social media platforms, [5, 6] and \nmarketing of food and supplement products has become \nprolific [7, 8]. There is a growing body of evidence that \nindicates food and nutrition content and marketing \non social media has the power to influence food choice \n[9\u201312].\nAs the Internet has become more accessible, individu-\nals have increasingly utilised it to source information \nabout nutrition. Consumers seek nutrition information \nfor various reasons including health management, curi-\nosity, and interest\u00a0 [13]. Nutrition information is con-\ntent that provides the general public with guidance on \nsourcing, storing, preparing and consuming food to sup-\nport good health, and includes recipes, product details, \nhealthy-eating advice and nutritional requirements \n(defined in full in Table\u00a01). Increases in online nutrition \ninformation seeking behaviour have been observed in \nAmerica, [14] Canada, [15] France, [16] and Norway, [17] \nand the Internet is the primary source of nutrition infor-\nmation for Australians [18, 19]. Social media has become \na ubiquitous part of the Internet and consumers search \nfor and follow food and nutrition-related content on \nsocial media [6, 20\u201322]. A survey of American Instagram \nusers found that 87% of female users followed nutrition-\nrelated content on the platform [6]. Consumers not only \nseek information about food and nutrition on social \nmedia they are also passively exposed to it in their social \nmedia feeds without intentionally searching for it [23, \n24]. Due to the influence of social media algorithms and \npaid sponsorships, social media users are also presented \nwith content in their feed from entities that they do not \nfollow. Furthermore, content can be published by anyone, \nregardless of their qualifications, level of expertise in the \ntopic or conflicting interests.\nAccurate and high-quality information is essential \nfor effective health communication and promotion. In \nhealth communication literature, accuracy refers to \nhealth information\u2019s factual correctness, and quality \nrefers to information\u2019s reliability when assessed using \ndefined quality criteria (see Table\u00a0 1) [25, 26]. Quality \nand accuracy are two important but distinct compo-\nnents of information\u2019s overall reliability. It is possible \nfor information to be accurate but of low quality and \nvice versa. Previous studies have assessed the accu-\nracy of online nutrition information against authorita-\ntive sources such as dietary guidelines, authoritative \nreports and peer reviewed literature [25]. Numerous \nquality assessment tools have been used to evaluate \nthe quality of online nutrition information, such as the \nDISCERN Instrument, [27]. Journal of the American \nMedical Association Benchmarks, [28] and Health on \nthe Net Code Principles [7, 29]. These tools share com-\nmon quality criteria, such as, declaring financial inter-\nests, citing sources, authorship by an individual with \nrelevant health-related qualifications, and disclosure of \nthe author\u2019s qualifications. Principles for Health-related \nInformation on Social Media (PRHISM), is a recently \ndeveloped quality assessment tool, which includes \nthese established quality principles and additional \nprinciples that are relevant to social media, including \naccessibility and readability [30]. There is a broad con-\nsensus in the literature that health information of sub-\noptimal quality and accuracy is extremely prevalent on \nsocial media [26, 31]. Concerningly, misinformation is \noften more popular than truthful information, receives \nhigher user engagement and spreads more quickly than \nthe truth due to its novelty [31, 32]. Furthermore, the \nnarrative of health misinformation often includes and \npromotes mistrust in authoritative institutions and \nTable\u202f1\u2002 Key definitions\na From Denniss et\u00a0al. [25]\nAccuracy: The factual correctness of\u00a0information when\u00a0compared to\u00a0authoritative sources of\u00a0information such as\u00a0systematic reviews, meta analyses \nor\u00a0national dietary guidelines [25].\nQuality: The reliability of\u00a0information as\u00a0assessed by\u00a0quality criteria [26]. Quality criteria typically include components such as\u00a0readability, inclusion of\u00a0ref-\nerences, transparency about\u00a0financial interests and\u00a0disclosure of\u00a0the\u00a0author\u2019s identity and\u00a0qualifications\naNutrition-related information: information regarding\u00a0healthy eating, dietary patterns, nutrients, nutritional requirements, nutritional composition \nof\u00a0foods, nutritional supplements, health outcomes associated with\u00a0foods and\u00a0dietary patterns, food safety, food ethics, cooking and\u00a0recipes intended \nfor\u00a0the\u00a0general public [25].\nPage 3 of 14\nDenniss\u00a0et\u00a0al. Int J Behav Nutr Phys Act           (2024) 21:16 \n\t\nexperts [31]. Social media-based misinformation can \nhave consequences for public health, for example, the \nonline anti-vaccination movement is believed to have \ncontributed to a reduction in vaccination rates and the \nreemergence of previously eradicated communicable \ndiseases [31, 33].\nPublic health nutrition experts and organisations have \nraised concerns about the potential for nutrition-related \nmisinformation to cause serious harm and undermine \ncredible nutrition communication. Exposure to nutri-\ntion information that lacks context or contradicts previ-\nous messaging can lead to confusion and backlash, which \nhas been evidenced to reduce consumers\u2019 willingness \nto engage in healthful behaviours and accept advice by \nauthoritative nutrition experts [34, 35]. If dietary behav-\niours are based on misinformation that contradicts evi-\ndence-based dietary guidelines, it may put individuals at \ngreater risk of developing non-communicable diseases \nthat are associated with unhealthy dietary patterns [1]. A \nrecent systematic review of studies evaluating the quality \nand accuracy of nutrition-related information published \non websites and social media found that generally infor-\nmation was of suboptimal quality and accuracy [25]. A \nsmall number of studies in the review investigated cer-\ntain social media (e.g., blogs, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter \nand WhatsApp), meaning other platforms, such as Insta-\ngram have had limited attention [25]. A further limitation \nwas that quality assessment tools designed for different \nsettings, for example, websites, were used to evaluate the \nsocial media content [25]. Furthermore, it was also rare \nfor studies to involve multiple researchers when screen-\ning posts to evaluate, which is a potential source of bias \n[25]. One recent study that was not captured within the \ndate-range of the systematic review examined the qual-\nity of nutrition-related information on Instagram find-\ning that quality was extremely low [36]. However, this \nstudy measured quality as a single criterion, rather than \nusing an extensive quality assessment method, and thus \nmay not have comprehensively measured the quality of \ninformation.\nTo the knowledge of the authors, thus far no studies \nhave assessed the accuracy of nutrition information on \nInstagram, and none have used social media specific tools \nto evaluate the quality of nutrition-related Instagram \ncontent. Instagram was the third most popular social \nmedia platform in Australia, and the fifth most visited \nwebsite in the world in 2021, [3,\u00a037] and nutrition is one \nof the most frequently discussed health topics on Insta-\ngram [5]. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evalu-\nate the quality and accuracy of nutrition information \nposted by popular Australian Instagram accounts using \nthe PRHISM tool to assess quality. A secondary aim was \nto examine trends in information quality and accuracy by \nauthor, topic, post engagement, account verification and \nnumber of followers.\nMethods\nStudy design and\u00a0data collection\nThe present study involved a cross-sectional evaluation \nof the quality and accuracy of nutrition-related infor-\nmation published on Instagram by Australian influencer \nor brand accounts. The Strengthening the Reporting of \nObservational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guide-\nlines were followed and the checklist is available in Sup-\nplementary Table\u00a01 [38]. A subsample of Instagram posts \ncollected for a wider project formed the dataset for this \nstudy and data collection has been described in detail \nelsewhere [7]. Briefly, a list of the top 1,000 Australian \nhealth Instagram accounts as of April 2021 was screened \nto determine eligibility [39]. Australian accounts with \nover 100,000 followers, a minimum of 100 posts, their \nmost recent post published within two weeks, and a \nminimum of 25% of their content relating to nutrition \nwere included. The figure of 100,000 followers was cho-\nsen because accounts with over 100,000 followers are \nconsidered to be macro influencers or above (over one \nmillion followers is considered to be a mega influencer) \n[40]. Social media users tend to trust the influencers and \nbrands that they follow, [41] and the purpose of this study \nwas to capture information posted by popular Austral-\nian Instagram accounts, therefore, only accounts with \ngreater than 100,000 followers were considered eligible \nfor inclusion. Accounts appearing under the \u201csuggested\u201d \ntab on the Instagram page of included accounts were \nalso screened. Screening was done between May and July \n2021 using an Instagram account made specifically for \nthe project and using Google Chrome\u2019s incognito mode \nto minimise the impact of the algorithm on the sug-\ngested accounts. Two researchers (ED and JV, named in \nacknowledgements) independently screened all accounts \nand disagreements were discussed until agreement was \nreached.\nAll posts by eligible accounts from a twelve-month \nperiod (September 2020 \u2013 September 2021) were down-\nloaded through a paid subscription to Keyhole, an online \nsocial media analytics tool. The data extracted through \nKeyhole included each post\u2019s text-based caption, engage-\nment (sum of likes and comments), the date of upload \nand each account\u2019s bio, number of followers and if it \nwas verified with a blue tick. Each post was manually \nscreened for relevance. Video content including Reels \nand posts that did not refer to one or more component \nof nutrition-related information, as defined in Table\u00a0 1, \nwere excluded. Ten percent of posts were screened inde-\npendently by the lead author (ED) and a research assis-\ntant (JV) for relevance to nutrition information, with 94% \nPage 4 of 14\nDenniss\u00a0et\u00a0al. Int J Behav Nutr Phys Act           (2024) 21:16 \nagreement. The screening resulted in a sample of 10,964 \nInstagram posts containing nutrition-related informa-\ntion, which have been characterised in a previous content \nanalysis study [7].\nFor this study, a random stratified (by Instagram \naccount) subsample of the 10,964 posts were selected and \nscreened further for eligibility. A total of 2,025 posts were \nrandomly selected to be screened (up to 35 posts from \neach of the included Instagram accounts). The random \nsubsample for screening was selected using the sample \nfunction in Stata in March 2022. Posts that promoted a \nproduct but did not include any information about the \nhealth benefits of the product, for example, promotion of \na supplement without mention of its benefits, and posts \nthat only included recipes or meal ideas and no additional \ninformation were excluded because these posts did not \nprovide nutrition guidance that could be evaluated for \naccuracy or quality. All other posts were deemed eligible. \nScreening was done independently by two researchers \n(all posts screened by ED and with secondary screening \nby SM, LM or research assistant JL). Disagreements were \ndiscussed by the two researchers responsible for screen-\ning the relevant post until consensus was reached.\nQuality and\u00a0accuracy evaluations\nThe quality of information was evaluated using the \nPRHISM tool [30]. PRHISM was developed as a tool to \nevaluate the quality of social media-based information \nabout any health-related topic and considers the unique \ncharacteristics of social media content, for example, \ncovert advertising and brevity of information. To the \nknowledge of the authors, PRHISM is the only qual-\nity assessment tool that has been specifically developed \nfor health information delivered via social media. Other \ntools for evaluating the quality of health-related informa-\ntion exist. However, these tools were developed for dif-\nferent settings, such as websites or patient information \npamphlets and their use to evaluate health-related social \nmedia content has been scrutinised in the literature [25, \n42, 43]. PRHISM was developed in a Delphi study, which \ninvolved a panel of 18 expert participants [30]. The par-\nticipants were experts in health communication or a \nhealth-related field, used social media to communicate \nabout health and worked in academia, public health, \ncommunications and/or as health professionals. Three \nDelphi surveys were undertaken to determine group con-\nsensus about the principles to include in PRHISM. Prin-\nciples were based on quality criteria from previous tools \nand adapted to suit social media or were new principles \nsuggested by the expert panel. After the third Delphi sur-\nvey, a draft of the PRHISM scoring tool and guide for use \nwas circulated to participants for feedback about face \nvalidity and participants agreed with the final wording of \nthe principles and guide [30].\nPRHISM consists of thirteen principles that are scored \nfrom zero to four [30]. A number of principles may not \nbe relevant to evaluate depending on the nature of the \nsocial media post being evaluated, for example, principle \n8 relates to privacy and is only relevant to evaluate if the \npost discusses a client or patient. The overall PRHISM \nscore is weighted proportionately as a percentage of the \ntotal available score, whereby principles that are deemed \nnot relevant do not contribute to the total available score. \nThe overall PRHISM score ranges from 0 \u2013 100 where a \nhigher score indicates higher quality. A score of zero to \n25 is considered poor, 26\u2013 50 mediocre, 51 \u2013 75 good \nand 76 \u2013 100 excellent quality [30]. All images and infor-\nmation contained within the post, information in the \naccount holder\u2019s bio and information contained in links \nprovided within the post or bio were considered in qual-\nity evaluations, as outlined in the PRHISM protocol [30]. \nA summary of the PRHISM assessment principles is \nincluded in Table\u00a02.\nTo determine accuracy, the information contained in \nthe Instagram posts was evaluated against information \ncontained in the Australian Dietary Guidelines (ADG) \n[44] Nutrient Reference Values (NRVs), Practice-based \nEvidence in Nutrition Global Resource for Nutrition \nPractice (PEN), [45] and/or Metafact fact-checking plat-\nform. [46] Metafact is a website that enables the public \nto ask questions, which are answered by verified PhDs, \nresearchers and medical specialists.[46] Multiple experts \ncan answer the questions and if\u2009\u2265\u200970% of verified experts \nagree on an answer, it is deemed that consensus has \nbeen achieved [46]. Only questions with consensus were \nused for accuracy evaluations. A large number of posts \nwithin the sample contained claims about the benefits of \ncollagen supplementation for skin health, however, rel-\nevant information was not contained within the chosen \nauthoritative resources. Therefore, a recent systematic \nreview about collagen supplementation was also used to \ndetermine the accuracy of claims about collagen and skin \nhealth [47]. An accuracy coding framework was devel-\noped and was informed by a systematic review of the \nquality and accuracy of online nutrition information [25]. \nPosts were coded as containing information that is com-\npletely inaccurate (0), mostly inaccurate with some accu-\nracies (1), mostly accurate with some inaccuracies (2), \ncompletely accurate (3) or not assessable (4) (see Table\u20092 \nfor descriptions of accuracy categories). All the nutrition \ninformation within a post was considered when evaluat-\ning accuracy. If posts contained information about nutri-\ntion and other topics, such as sleep or exercise, only the \ninformation about nutrition was evaluated. Some posts \ncontained claims about the health benefits of specific \nPage 5 of 14\nDenniss\u00a0et\u00a0al. Int J Behav Nutr Phys Act           (2024) 21:16 \n\t\nproducts, such as supplements, but did not contain suffi-\ncient information about the nutrients or ingredients con-\ntained in the product for an assessment to be made. In \nthese instances, additional information about the prod-\nuct was sourced from its website in order to evaluate the \naccuracy of the claims.\nAssessments were conducted and recorded in a pur-\npose-designed REDCap database. A set of coding rules \nwas developed to ensure that information that appeared \nmultiple times in the sample of posts was coded consist-\nently for accuracy. Before completing the quality and \naccuracy evaluations, a random 10% if the sample was \nevaluated independently by two authors (ED and LM) for \ninter-rater reliability, achieving 79% agreement for quality \ncategory and 85% for accuracy score. Disagreements \nregarding quality or accuracy evaluations were discussed \nby ED and LM until consensus was reached. Common \nreasons for disagreement were discussed and relevant \nupdates to the study protocol were made before the \nremaining evaluations were completed to improve rigor. \nED conducted the quality and accuracy assessments for \nthe remainder of the sample to further improve consist-\nency. Posts containing information that was difficult to \nevaluate were discussed before reaching a decision. Ins-\ntagram accounts and the topic of Instagram posts were \ninductively categorised. The categories for Instagram \naccounts were developed by the two researchers (ED and \nJV) who undertook the screening of Instagram accounts, \nTable\u202f2\u2002 Summary of quality principles assessed by the PRHISM tool and accuracy score categories\nAbbreviations: PRHISM: Principles for Health-related Information on Social Media\na From: Denniss et\u00a0al.

Int J Behav Nutr Phys Act           (2024) 21:16 \nafter screening had concluded and both researchers were \nimmersed in the data. Each included account was inde-\npendently categorised, and disagreements were discussed \nby ED and JV until agreement was reached. The catego-\nries for Instagram accounts were used in the preceding \nstudy for which the data was originally collected [7]. \nCategories for post topic were developed during the reli-\nability assessments based on the most frequent nutrition-\nrelated topics mentioned in the posts and all posts were \ncategorised by the first author. Descriptions of account \nand topic categories are summarised in Supplementary \nTable\u00a02.\nStatistical analysis\nData was exported from REDCap and statistical analyses \nwere performed in Stata/SE v17.0 (StataCorp, College \nStation, TX). Descriptive statistics were run. Multilevel \nmixed-effects models were used to estimate quality \nscores for account categories, post topics, account veri-\nfication, accuracy score, follower count, engagement, \nand engagement rate. Marginal means of quality scores \nfor account categories and post topics were calculated. \nPairwise comparisons were run to determine mean dif-\nferences in quality scores across account categories, post \ntopics and accuracy categories. Mixed-effects ordered \nlogistic regression models were used to estimate accu-\nracy score outcomes for account categories, post top-\nics, account verification, follower count, engagement \nand engagement rate. Pairwise comparisons were run \nto determine mean differences in quality scores across \naccount categories and post topics. Mixed-effects models \nwere chosen to account for the structure of the data, with \nthe possibility of repeat measures (i.e., multiple posts) \nfor each Instagram account, with posts being the unit \nof analysis and the models including random intercepts \nfor Instagram accounts. Quality and accuracy scores \nwere treated as the dependent variable. Engagement and \nengagement rate had positively skewed distributions and \nwere log transformed. One account had an outlying num-\nber of followers (>\u20092,000,000) and was thus removed from \nanalyses involving follower counts. After removing the \noutlying account, follower counts remained skewed and \nwere also log transformed to achieve normal distribution. \nAnalysis was run with and without the outlying account \nshowing little difference to the result (data not shown). \nStatistical significance was set at P\u2009<\u20090.05.\nEthics\nThe Instagram posts included in this study were pub-\nlicly available. Due to the public nature of the data, this \nstudy was exempt from formal review by an ethics com-\nmittee. To ensure that this study upholds ethical research \nstandards, no identifying information about the account-\nholders has been published.\nResults\nA total of 676 posts from 47 accounts were included in \nthe final sample (Fig.\u00a01, Table\u00a03). Accounts had an aver-\nage of 314,817 followers. The most common topic dis-\ncussed in posts was supplements (36.4%) followed by \nfoods/nutrients and health (17.2%), general healthy eat-\ning (16.0%), weight loss (13.5%), sports/exercise nutrition \n(6.7%), other (5.5%) and paediatric nutrition (4.9%).\nQuality\nOverall, 34.8% (n\u2009=\u2009235) of posts were classified as poor, \n59.2% (n\u2009=\u2009400) mediocre, 6.1% (n\u2009=\u200941) good and zero \nposts were classified as excellent quality. The mean \nPRHISM score was mediocre (31.8\u2009\u00b1\u200910.3 out of a pos-\nsible score of 100) and scores varied across principles \n(Table\u00a0 4). Only two principles had a mean score above \ntwo (4. Financial disclosure and 13. Images) (Table\u00a0 5). \nPosts authored by accounts in the nutritionist/dietitian \ninfluencer account category were associated with higher \nquality scores compared to the reference group (brands) \n(\u03b2, 17.8, CI 13.94\u201321.65; P\u2009<\u20090.001) and all other account \ncategories. Posts that contained information about foods/\nnutrients and health or general healthy eating were \nassociated with higher quality scores compared to the \nreference group (weight loss information) and posts con-\ntaining information about supplements. There was no \nassociation between information quality and accounts \nbeing verified (\u03b2 0.572, P\u2009=\u20090.821) or follower count (\u03b2 \n-1.18, P\u2009=\u20090.643). Lower quality scores were associated \nwith higher engagement (\u03b2 -0.59, P\u2009=\u20090.012) and higher \nengagement rate (\u03b2 -0.57, P\u2009=\u20090.016), although these dif-\nferences were small. A complete summary of the results \nfrom the mixed effects analysis of quality scores by \naccount type and post topic is provided in Supplemen-\ntary Table\u00a03 and 4.\nAccuracy\nFrom the 676 posts included in the sample, 166 were not \nassessable and a total of 510 posts were evaluated for \naccuracy (see Fig.\u00a0 1). Of the posts that were evaluated \nfor accuracy, 44.7% (n\u2009=\u2009228) of posts contained inac-\ncuracies, 8.6% (n\u2009=\u200944) of posts were completely inac-\ncurate, 14.3% (n\u2009=\u200973) mostly inaccurate, 21.8% (111) \nmostly accurate and 55.3% (n\u2009=\u2009282) completely accurate. \nPosts published by fitness influencers had higher odds of \nreceiving a higher score for accuracy compared to posts \npublished by brands (OR 3.09, CI 1.21\u20137.87, P\u2009=\u20090.018) \nas did posts published by nutritionist/dietitian influencer \naccounts (OR 4.69, CI 1.81\u201312.14, P\u2009=\u20090.001).

There was no difference in odds of receiving a \nhigher accuracy score for posts authored by a verified or \nnon-verified account (OR 2.07, CI 0.87\u20134.94, P\u2009=\u20090.10), \nfollower count (OR 1.12, CI 0.46\u20132.69, P\u2009=\u20090.803), \nengagement (OR 1.02, CI 0.84\u20131.24, P\u2009=\u20090.831) or engage-\nment rate (OR 1.0, CI 0.82\u20131.21, P\u2009=\u20090.960). A complete \nsummary of the results from the mixed effects analysis \nof accuracy scores by account type and post topic is pro-\nvided in Supplementary Table\u00a03 and 4.\nPosts that were completely accurate were associated \nwith higher quality scores compared to posts that were \ncompletely inaccurate (\u03b2 2.24, CI 0.29\u20134.19, P\u2009=\u20090.024). \nHowever, the differences in quality scores between posts \ncontaining completely accurate versus completely inac-\ncurate information was small. There was no difference in \nquality scores observed for posts containing mostly inac-\ncurate or mostly accurate information.\nDiscussion\nThis content analysis study evaluated the quality and \naccuracy of nutrition-related information posted by \npopular Australian Instagram accounts. Results indicate \nFig.\u202f1\u2002 Flow chart of\u00a0sample selection process\nPage 8 of 14\nDenniss\u00a0et\u00a0al. Int J Behav Nutr Phys Act           (2024) 21:16 \nthat most information posted by Australian accounts is of \nlow to moderate quality and almost half of posts contain \ninaccuracies. Information about supplements or posted \nby brand accounts tended to be of lower quality and \naccuracy compared to other topics and authors of infor-\nmation. Australian nutritionist and dietitian accounts \nposted higher quality information that was more likely to \nbe accurate.\nOverall, the quality and accuracy of nutrition-related \nInstagram posts included in this study was poor and \nposts that were of lower quality received higher engage-\nment. These findings are consistent with content analyses \nof nutrition-related information from YouTube, [48\u201351] \nInstagram, [36] WhatsApp, [52] Twitter, [53] Facebook, \n[54] and blogs, [55] which found large proportions of \ninaccurate and poor quality information. Furthermore, a \nstudy on YouTube videos about nutrition following bari-\natric surgery found that poor quality and inaccurate vid-\neos were the most popular [50]. Conversely, studies about \nhealthy eating information on blogs [56] and information \nabout food safety and eating for coeliac disease on You-\nTube [57, 58] have found information to be accurate and \nof fair to high quality. More broadly, studies about health-\nrelated information on social media have found that \nhealth misinformation is abundant on social media plat-\nforms and is often more popular than factual information \n[31]. A small association between information accuracy \nand quality was observed, which is consistent with previ-\nous research that has seen a very weak correlation [59] \nor no correlation [60] between the quality and accuracy \nof nutrition-related information. Findings from this study \nand the health and nutrition communication literature \nsuggest that Instagram and other social media users are \nlikely to be exposed to suboptimal and misleading nutri-\ntion information. Furthermore, over a third of posts in \nthis study contained a combination of accurate and inac-\ncurate information, which may make it difficult for con-\nsumers to identify accurate information when engaging \nwith nutrition-related posts by Australian accounts. The \ngenerally low PRHISM scores that Australian accounts \nreceived suggest that consumers may be presented with \ninformation that is difficult to understand and lacks suf-\nficient context or evidence, which may undermine public \nhealth nutrition efforts and contribute to confusion and \nbacklash [34, 35].\nInformation about supplements and information \nposted by brand accounts was of the lowest quality and \naccuracy consistent with existing research. A systematic \nreview of the quality and accuracy of online nutrition \ninformation found that information published by com-\nmercial entities was often of the lowest quality and accu-\nracy, however, this finding was not consistent throughout \nthe included studies and there was variation in which \npublishers provided the most reliable information [25]. \nThe same review also found that information about sup-\nplements was typically inaccurate and of low quality [25]. \nSimilarly, Basch et\u00a0al. found that YouTube videos about \nmultivitamin supplements were of poor quality, [49] and \na small analysis of Instagram posts containing #immune-\nbooster found numerous inaccurate claims about the \nimmune boosting benefits of supplements during the \nCOVID-19 pandemic [61]. Marketing from brands and \ninfluencers dominates social media and the marketing of \nsupplements is prevalent on Instagram [4, 7]. The inac-\ncurate and poor-quality information about supplements \nand posted by Australian brand accounts observed in \nthis study may indicate that exaggerated information may \nbe used as a marketing tactic on Instagram. While con-\nsumers should be critical of nutrition information pro-\nvided by commercial entities or alongside the marketing \nTable\u202f3\u2002 Characteristics of Instagram accounts (n\u2009=\u200947) and Instagram posts (n\u2009=\u2009676) included in total sample\nInstagram \naccount \ncategory (n)\nTotal posts \nin sample \nn (%)\nFollowers \n(mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard \ndeviation)\nPost topic n (%)\nWeight loss Sports/\nexercise \nnutrition\nSupplements\nFoods/\nnutrients & \nhealth\nGeneral \nhealthy \neating\nPaediatric \nnutrition\nOther\nAll (47)\n676 (100)\n271,789\u2009\u00b1\u2009293,101\n91 (13.5)\n45 (6.7)\n246 (36.4)\n116 (17.2)\n108 (16.0)\n33 (4.9)\n37 (5.5)\nBy account category\n\u2003 Brand (22)\n328 (48.5)\n230,188\u2009\u00b1\u200996,768\n33 (10.1)\n5 (1.5)\n208 (63.4)\n50 (15.2)\n26 (7.9)\n0 (0)\n7 (2.1)\n\u2003 \u2003 Fitness/\ncoaching \ninfluencer (9)\n146 (21.6)\n448,946\u2009\u00b1\u2009626,286\n46 (31.5)\n39 (26.7)\n23 (15.8)\n12 (8.2)\n23 (15.8)\n0 (0)\n3 (2.1)\n\u2003 Lifestyle \ninfluencer (8)\n57 (8.4)\n285,787\u2009\u00b1\u2009152,421\n3 (5.3)\n0 (0)\n11 (19.3)\n18 (31.6)\n19 (33.3)\n0 (0)\n6 (10.5)\n\u2003 Nutrition-\nist/dietitian \ninfluencer (8)\n145 (21.4)\n172,888\u2009\u00b1\u200988,051\n9 (6.2)\n1 (0.7)\n4 (2.8)\n36 (24.8)\n41 (28.3)\n33 (22.8)\n21 (14.5)\nPage 9 of 14\nDenniss\u00a0et\u00a0al.

In 2022, \nan Australian supplement company with a large social \nmedia presence was fined $26,640 AUD by the Therapeu-\ntic Goods Administration for unlawful claims about their \nsupplements and cancer and Alzheimer\u2019s prevention [62]. \nMore frequent and severe prosecution for misleading \ninformation may help disincentivise commercial entities \nfrom making false claims.\nIn this study posts by Australian nutritionists and \ndietitians generally received higher quality and accuracy \nscores than posts by other accounts. This is consistent \nwith results from a recent analysis of nutrition-related \nInstagram content, where posts categorised as \u201cnutrition \nand dietetics\u201d received higher quality evaluations com-\npared to other categories such as \u201cfitness\u201d and \u201cmotiva-\ntion\u201d [36]. Furthermore, previous accuracy evaluations of \nwebsite content authored by registered dietitians versus \nnutritionists found that dietitians provided more accu-\nrate information in two studies based in Canada and the \nUnited States, where the title \u201cnutritionist\u201d is not regu-\nlated [63, 64] However, contrasting results were observed \nin an international analysis of tweets by dietitians, which \nfound that 58% of tweets were not evidence based [53].\nAlthough information posted by Australian nutrition-\nists and dietitians was of the highest quality and accu-\nracy in this study, no posts were classified as excellent \nquality and inaccuracies were detected in over a quarter \nof their posts. In recent years, the public\u2019s trust in nutri-\ntion science has generally eroded [65, 66]. Factors such \nas scientific uncertainty, conflicts of interest \u2013 both real \nand perceived, and insufficient context and contradictory \nmessaging in nutrition communication have diminished \nthe public\u2019s trust in credible and authoritative voices in \nnutrition science.[65, 66] It is important for nutrition \nexperts to post high-quality and accurate information \nto prevent the worsening of mistrust in nutrition sci-\nence. The quality scores observed may reflect the higher \nengagement received by posts that were lower in quality \nand nutrition professionals may be developing content \nthat conforms with what is popular on social media to \nincrease their reach and engagement. Regardless, Aus-\ntralian nutritionists and dietitians should improve the \nquality of their posts by including references, referring \nreaders to relevant health professionals, and ensuring \ninformation is accessible, avoids jargon and is written at \nan appropriate reading level [30, 67]. In this study it was \nrare for nutrition professionals to adequately describe \ntheir qualifications in their Instagram bios. Providing \nmore information about education and accreditation \nmay improve the quality of nutrition professionals\u2019 health \ncommunication and indicate their expertise to consum-\ners [30]. However, increasing transparency regarding \nqualifications may not result in increased uptake of nutri-\ntion advice from credentialed experts, given the public\u2019s \ndiminished trust in the field.\nThis study had a number of key strengths. Use of the \nPRHISM tool to evaluate information quality is a strength \nas it was designed for social media content and measures \naspects of information quality that are unique to social \nmedia [43]. Typically, studies evaluating the quality of \nhealth or nutrition-related social media content have \nused tools developed for different contexts, which may \nnot be appropriate for social media [25]. All posts were \nscreened by two researchers and a random 10% of posts \nwere evaluated twice for reliability. Furthermore, this \nstudy included a large sample of posts collected over a \n12-month period, which may improve the generalisability \nof results. There are also limitations to consider. Firstly, a \nportion of posts were coded as \u201cnot assessable\u201d because \nthe information in the post was not contained in the \nresources used to review accuracy. As such, the amount \nof inaccurate information may have been underestimated \nbecause only common nutrition myths were contained \nin the resources and less common inaccuracies were not. \nSecondly, agreement on reliability measures for quality \nand accuracy evaluations was moderate. However, pro-\ntocols were improved based on common disagreements \nand the remainder of evaluations were done by one \nauthor to improve consistency. Thirdly, it is not possible \nto determine the influence of bots on follower counts or \nTable\u202f5\u2002 Quality scores for nutrition-related Instagram posts by \nprinciple of the PRHISM tool and overall score\nEach principle in PRHISM is scored from 0 to 4, where a higher score indicates \nhigher quality.

Int J Behav Nutr Phys Act           (2024) 21:16 \n\t\nengagement or if the Instagram accounts included in the \nsample was comprehensive of all prominent accounts \nthat post nutrition-related information. This is because \nbots are difficult to detect and Instagram restricts access \nto their application programming interface (API), mean-\ning that much of Instagram\u2019s data cannot be accessed or \nsystematically searched. However, limited access to APIs \nand the influence of algorithms and bots are common \nlimitations in social media research. Fourthly, the Insta-\ngram data used in this study was sourced from Australian \nInstagram accounts and may therefore not be generalis-\nable to nutrition-related Instagram content published in \ndifferent geographical locations. Finally, Reels and other \nvideo content was not included in this study because it \nwas not feasible to transcribe video content for analy-\nsis. Reels have grown in popularity since the data was \ncollected [68] and future research should investigate \nthe quality and accuracy of nutrition-related Instagram \nReels.\nFindings from this content analysis have implications \nfor policy, practice, and future research. In Australia \nregulatory bodies have handed down fines for mislead-\ning claims, [62] prohibited influencer marketing of \ntherapeutic goods, such as supplements, [69] and put \na call out to social media users to report influencers \nwho do not disclose brand partnerships [70]. These are \npromising steps toward curbing unreliable health and \nnutrition misinformation. However, regulatory bodies \nand the public should not bear all responsibility and \ndo not have sufficient resources for comprehensive \nsurveillance and monitoring of social media and the \nfindings from this study highlight the failure of cur-\nrent public health measures to adequately tackle this \nissue in Australia. Social media companies should do \nmore to regulate content on their platforms, which is \nstrongly recommended by the World Health Organiza-\ntion [71]. For example, social media platforms could \nverify the qualifications of health professionals and \nintroduce features that enable content creators to \neasily include references in posts and refer individu-\nals to local health organisations to improve credible \ncommunication that aligns with PRHISM and World \nHealth Organization recommendations [30, 71]. Fur-\nthermore, the current system that social media, food, \nwellness and supplement companies operate within, \nprioritises profit over human and planetary health \nand is acknowledged within commercial determinants \nof health framework [72]. A substantial reorientation \nof this system to prioritise health over profit may be \nmore effective for preventing health misinformation \nthan reprimanding individual influencers or brands \nfor misleading consumers. Nutrition experts also \nhave a role to play and should ensure that the con-\ntent they publish on social media is accurate and of a \nhigh quality. Support for nutritionists, dietitians, and \nother experts can be provided by professional bod-\nies and institutions to embed media and communica-\ntions training within tertiary education and continuing \nprofessional development. Nutrition communication \nhas been outlined as a priority area in the Australian \nNational Committee for Nutrition decadal plan for \nthe science of nutrition, highlighting the importance \nof communication to the field of nutrition [73]. Future \nresearch should characterise who is exposed to nutri-\ntion misinformation, and who engages with, shares \nand believes misinformation. Additionally, more work \nis needed to understand how nutrition misinforma-\ntion may be influencing the dietary choices consum-\ners are making. Further analysis by topic may also yield \nhelpful insights. Considering the importance of infant \nnutrition, the paediatric topic area could be a signifi-\ncant are to focus future efforts. Finally, research is \nneeded to develop methods of measuring health mis-\ninformation\u2019s severity and potential for harm so that \npotential impacts can be estimated.\nConclusion\nThis content analysis found that a large proportion of \nnutrition-related information posted by influential Aus-\ntralian Instagram accounts is of suboptimal quality and \naccuracy. Instagram users who follow and engage with \nnutrition-related Instagram content posted by Austral-\nian influencers and brands may be at risk of being mis-\ninformed. Information about supplements and content \nposted by brand accounts was more likely to contain \ninaccuracies and be of lower quality. Posts by dieti-\ntians and nutritionists were higher in quality and more \nlikely to be accurate. The public should be sceptical of \nthe credibility of nutrition-related Instagram content \nthat includes marketing and seek out information pro-\nvided by nutritionists and dietitians over other entities \non Instagram. Although information posted by Austral-\nian dietitians and nutritionists was of the highest qual-\nity and accuracy, there is scope for improvement and \nnutrition experts should prioritise providing credible \nand reliable nutrition communication on social media.\nAbbreviations\nADG\t\n\u0007Australian Dietary Guidelines\nNRV\t\n\u0007Nutrient Reference Values\nPEN\t\n\u0007Practice-based Evidence in Nutrition\nPRHISM\t\n\u0007Principles for Health-related Information on Social Media\nSTROBE\t\n\u0007Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology\nPage 12 of 14\nDenniss\u00a0et\u00a0al.

(Zis et al., 2021) \nInstagram merupakan salah satu platform yang populer dan digunakan oleh hampir semua \ngenerasi Z. Gen Z cenderung menggunakan Instagram sebagai alat untuk membangun identitas \ndigital, personal branding, dan ruang untuk menjadi diri mereka sendiri. Mereka juga menikmati \nkonten yang menghibur, terlibat dalam aksi sosial, dan dapat mempersonalisasi identitas digital \nmereka melalui platform ini. \nBeberapa penelitian juga menyoroti bahwa Instagram memainkan peran dalam pembentukan \nidentitas diri Gen Z dan bahwa Gen Z memiliki hubungan kompleks dengan media sosial seperti \nInstagram. Dengan demikian, dapat dikatakan bahwa Instagram memengaruhi cara Gen Z memahami \ndiri mereka dan berinteraksi dengan dunia di sekitar mereka. \n \nMETODE  \nDi dalam penelitian ini, peneliti menggunakan metode kualitatif Menurut Bogdan dan Taylor \ndalam Moleong, penelitian kualitatif sebagai prosedur penelitian yang menghasilkan data deskriptif \nberupa kata-kata tertulis atau lisan dari orang-orang dan perilaku yang dapat diamati (Moleong, 2010). \nAdapun pendekatan yang digunakan dalam penelitian ini adalah pendekatan deskriptif Secara \nkeseluruhan teknik analisis data yang dilakukan diawali dengan pengumpulan data dengan cara kajian \ndokumen dan literature review, reduksi data dan memilah informasi sesuai dengan tujuan penelitian, \nserta pengambilan kesimpulan. Adapun untuk validasi data peneliti menggunakan cara trianggulasi \nTriangulasi dalam pengujian kredibilitas ini diartikan sebagai pengecekan data dari berbagai sumber \ndengan berbagai cara, dan berbagai waktu. Dengan demikian terdapat triangulasi sumber, triangulasi \nteknik pengumpulan data dan triangulasi waktu. \n \nHASIL DAN DISKUSI  \nInstagram \nInstagram berasal dari kata \"insta\" atau \"instan\" yang terinspirasi dari kamera polaroid yang \ndulunya terkenal dengan sebutan \"foto instan\". Instagram awalnya hanya berfungsi sebagai platform \nuntuk berbagi foto, tetapi seiring waktu, Instagram pun kini bisa dijadikan sebagai ajang untuk \nmembuat konten video, upload video, insta story, dan masih banyak yang lainnya. Instagram menjadi \nsangat populer dan memiliki jutaan pengguna di seluruh dunia karena seringnya memberikan fitur \nyang inovatif untuk para penggunanya. Pada tanggal 9 April 2012, Facebook mengakuisisi Instagram \nsenilai hampir $1 miliar. Saat ini, Instagram memiliki fitur-fitur seperti Profesional Dashboard, \nRecently Delete, Matikan Video dan Audio ketika Live, Live Room, Reel Remix, Security Check Up, \ndan Insta Story. (Agianto et al., 2020) \nDalam beberapa tahun terakhir, Instagram telah berkembang pesat dan menjadi platform media \nsosial yang populer, diikuti oleh berbagai kelompok pengguna, termasuk remaja, millennium muda, \n"

Putri, Nurwati, dan S. Media sosial juga \nmerupakan tempat media berkonsentrasi pada eksistensi penggunanya, menurut Van Dijk (Nasrullah, \n2015). Istilah \"media sosial\" sering digunakan untuk merujuk pada jenis media baru yang \nmemungkinkan orang berpartisipasi secara interaktif (Manning, 2014). Sekarang orang dapat \nberinteraksi satu sama lain dalam skala besar lebih mudah daripada sebelum \nnya karena munculnya teknologi digital dan seluler. Akibatnya, interaktivitas adalah inti dari \nfungsi media baru. Satu orang sekarang dapat berbicara dengan banyak orang, dan ada kemungkinan \numpan balik instan. Sekarang orang-orang dan pelanggan memiliki suara yang lebih banyak dan tidak \nteredam daripada sebelumnya. (Manning, 2014) \nSalah satu perkembangan internet adalah media sosial. Kamera smartphone yang bagus \nmemungkinkan banyak orang melakukan aktivitas baru yang menyenangkan; orang dapat dengan \nmudah mengambil gambar di mana pun dan kapan pun dan kemudian menguploadnya ke media \nsosial. Beberapa jenis media sosial yang paling populer adalah Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, Path, \ndan Path. Instagram adalah aplikasi berbagi foto di mana pengguna dapat mengambil foto, \nmenggunakan filter digital, dan membagikannya ke berbagai layanan jejaring sosial. \nHasil penelitian  sebuah perusahaan riset dan analisis dari Inggris Masyarakat Indonesia senang \nmenggunakan Instagram untuk mencari inspirasi, berbagi petualangan, dan mengikuti tren terbaru. \nKomunitas pertama di ponsel juga telah menghasilkan hasil bisnis yang signifikan bagi perusahaan \nbesar maupun kecil di Indonesia. Sembilan puluh tujuh persen pengguna Instagram selalu menuliskan \nkomentar dan menandai teman-teman mereka; dan sembilan puluh tujuh persen menggunakan mesin \npencari untuk mencari informasi lebih lanjut. (Prihatiningsih, 2017) \nMedia sosial bukan ruang pribadi melainkan ruang publik bagi remaja. Berdasarkan observasi \nmereka bisa menghabiskan waktu ber jam-jam untuk menggunakan media sosial, entah itu untuk \nmeng-upload atau berbagi gambar, foto, video, hanya sekedar melihat-lihat, berkomentar di akun \ntemannya.Penelitiian ini ingin mendeskripsikan kebutuhan bermedia yang didapat remaja pada media \nsosial instagram.   \nOrang-orang yang lahir dimulai dari tahun 2001 sampai tahun 2010 disebut juga dengan \ngenerasi Z. karakteristik generasi ini adalah mereka tumbuh ketika teknologi sudah berkembang pesat, \ndimana personal kompuer, ponsel pintar, internet dan juga perangkat gaming sudah lumrah \ndigunakan. Generasi Z banyak menghabiskan waktu untuk berselancar di internet, seperti di web dan \njuga sosial media. Generasi Z cenderung menyukai kegiatan di dalam rumah daripada bermain di luar \nruangan dan berinteraksi dengan orang banyak. Hal ini disebabkan oleh kebiasaannya menggunakan \nteknologi sehingga banyak yang kecanduan. Generasi Z juga dikenal sebagai generasi yang serba \ninstan. Menginginkan hasil yang instan dan menyebabkan kemunculan teknologi artificial intelligent \nyang dapat membuat semua hal menjadi mudah. Karena kecendrungannya akan sesuatu yang cepat, \nPeranan Media Sosial Instagram terhadap Interaksi Sosial dan Etika pada Generasi Z, Kartini Sikumbang, Widya \nRamadhina, Emi Riska Yani, Della Arika, Nazmi Hayati, Nur Aini Hasibuan, Bagus Gigih Permana \n              11031 \n \n \ngenerasi Z juga banyak menemukan cara baru yang lebih efisien dalam mengerjakan sesuatu yang \nmana hal ini juga merupakan inovasi baru yang lahir karena kebiasaan ini. (Zis et al., 2021) \nInstagram merupakan salah satu platform yang populer dan digunakan oleh hampir semua \ngenerasi Z. Gen Z cenderung menggunakan Instagram sebagai alat untuk membangun identitas \ndigital, personal branding, dan ruang untuk menjadi diri mereka sendiri. Mereka juga menikmati \nkonten yang menghibur, terlibat dalam aksi sosial, dan dapat mempersonalisasi identitas digital \nmereka melalui platform ini. \nBeberapa penelitian juga menyoroti bahwa Instagram memainkan peran dalam pembentukan \nidentitas diri Gen Z dan bahwa Gen Z memiliki hubungan kompleks dengan media sosial seperti \nInstagram. Dengan demikian, dapat dikatakan bahwa Instagram memengaruhi cara Gen Z memahami \ndiri mereka dan berinteraksi dengan dunia di sekitar mereka. \n \nMETODE  \nDi dalam penelitian ini, peneliti menggunakan metode kualitatif Menurut Bogdan dan Taylor \ndalam Moleong, penelitian kualitatif sebagai prosedur penelitian yang menghasilkan data deskriptif \nberupa kata-kata tertulis atau lisan dari orang-orang dan perilaku yang dapat diamati (Moleong, 2010). \nAdapun pendekatan yang digunakan dalam penelitian ini adalah pendekatan deskriptif Secara \nkeseluruhan teknik analisis data yang dilakukan diawali dengan pengumpulan data dengan cara kajian \ndokumen dan literature review, reduksi data dan memilah informasi sesuai dengan tujuan penelitian, \nserta pengambilan kesimpulan. Adapun untuk validasi data peneliti menggunakan cara trianggulasi \nTriangulasi dalam pengujian kredibilitas ini diartikan sebagai pengecekan data dari berbagai sumber \ndengan berbagai cara, dan berbagai waktu. Dengan demikian terdapat triangulasi sumber, triangulasi \nteknik pengumpulan data dan triangulasi waktu. \n \nHASIL DAN DISKUSI  \nInstagram \nInstagram berasal dari kata \"insta\" atau \"instan\" yang terinspirasi dari kamera polaroid yang \ndulunya terkenal dengan sebutan \"foto instan\". Instagram awalnya hanya berfungsi sebagai platform \nuntuk berbagi foto, tetapi seiring waktu, Instagram pun kini bisa dijadikan sebagai ajang untuk \nmembuat konten video, upload video, insta story, dan masih banyak yang lainnya. Instagram menjadi \nsangat populer dan memiliki jutaan pengguna di seluruh dunia karena seringnya memberikan fitur \nyang inovatif untuk para penggunanya. Pada tanggal 9 April 2012, Facebook mengakuisisi Instagram \nsenilai hampir $1 miliar. Saat ini, Instagram memiliki fitur-fitur seperti Profesional Dashboard, \nRecently Delete, Matikan Video dan Audio ketika Live, Live Room, Reel Remix, Security Check Up, \ndan Insta Story. (Agianto et al., 2020) \nDalam beberapa tahun terakhir, Instagram telah berkembang pesat dan menjadi platform media \nsosial yang populer, diikuti oleh berbagai kelompok pengguna, termasuk remaja, millennium muda, \n11032           \n                              Journal on Education, Volume 06, No. 02, Januari-Februari 2024, hal. 11029-11037 \n \ndan pelaku bisnis. Instagram pertama kali diluncurkan pada bulan Oktober 2010 oleh Kevin Systrom \ndan Mike Krieger sebagai aplikasi check-in mobile bernama Burbn, Inc.  \nInstagram memiliki 2 miliar pengguna aktif tiap bulannya, yang menjadikan instagram platform \nsosial media terbanyak berdasarkan jumlah penggunanya di dunia. Instagram banyak digunakan oleh \ngenerasi Z salah satunya adalah karena Instagram merupakan platform sosial media visual yang ideal \nuntuk menampilkan produk dan berbagai jenis konten multimedia, banyaknya fitur yang bisa \ndigunakan menjadi daya tarik tersendiri.  \nSaat ini instagram bukan lagi sebagai alat komunikasi, namun menjadi platform aktualisasi diri \nyang populer. Seiring dengan populernya instagram makin banyak pula bermunculan influencer, atau \nyang kerap disebut sebagai selebriti instagram. Mereka adalah yang memiliki banyak followers di \ninstagram dan banyak yang mengidolakan mereka. Bidang yang digeluti juga bermacam-macam, \nseperti beauty, makanan, fashion, pendidikan, story telling dan masih banyak lagi.  \nAkibat banyaknya influencer yang bermunculan juga turut berpengaruh pada interaksi sosial \nbagi generasi Z, karena kecendrungan generasi Z untuk menirukan apa yang dilihat. Sebagian besar \ngenerasi Z melek informasi, artinya adalah dapat memilah informasi yang benar dan tidak benar hal \nini dikarenakan teknologi yang sudah berkembang pesat dan generasi Z mampu mengoperasikannya \ndengan baik.  \nPenelitian menunjukkan bahwa Instagram memiliki pengaruh yang signifikan pada generasi Z. \nPlatform ini tidak hanya berfungsi sebagai media untuk berbagi foto dan video, tetapi juga telah \nmenjadi sarana penting bagi influencer dan selebriti internet untuk mempromosikan berbagai produk, \ntermasuk produk fashion. Generasi Z cenderung menghabiskan waktu yang signifikan untuk \nmengakses dan berinteraksi dengan konten di Instagram, sehingga endorsement dan promosi produk \noleh influencer dapat memengaruhi preferensi dan keputusan pembelian mereka. (Sumartono et al., \n2015) \nSelain itu, Instagram juga mempengaruhi pola komunikasi generasi Z, terutama melalui fitur \nDirect Message (DM), yang digunakan secara aktif untuk berinteraksi dengan idola mereka. Dengan \ndemikian, dapat disimpulkan bahwa Instagram memainkan peran penting dalam membentuk \npreferensi, keputusan pembelian, dan pola komunikasi generasi Z. \nBerhasilnya Instagram menjadi platform media sosial populer berkembang pesat ini disebabkan \noleh beberapa faktor, yaitu : \n1. Fungsi Mobile: Instagram merupakan platform social media yang berbasis aplikasi mobile, \nsehingga mudah digunakan dimana saja \n2. Fleksibilitas: Instagram memungkinkan pengguna untuk membagikan konten tanpa harus diedit \ndan rekayasa, sehingga memudahkan pembagian konten \n3. Visualisasi: Manusia memang lebih mudah untuk menyaring informasi melalui visual \ndibandingkan teks, sehingga marketing visual menjadi populer \n4.

Selain itu, kita akan membahas bagaimana pengguna dapat \nmengoptimalkan pengalaman Instagram untuk meningkatkan interaksi sosial dan membangun jaringan yang \nkuat. Dalam hasil penelitian ini, kita akan membahas penggunaan Instagram oleh generasi Z dalam berbagai \naspek, mulai dari fitur yang digunakan hingga strategi pemasaran yang sukses. Dengan memahami peranan \nmedia sosial Instagram dalam interaksi sosial pada generasi Z, kita dapat menyimpulkan bahwa Instagram \nsangat berpotensi menjadi alat yang sangat penting dalam kehidupan dan kebangkitan generasi Z di dunia \ndigital. \nKata Kunci: Instagram, Generasi Z, Interaksi Sosial  \n \nCopyright (c) 2023 Kartini Sikumbang, Widya Ramadhina, Emi Riska Yani, Della Arika, Nazmi Hayati, Nur \nAini Hasibuan, Bagus Gigih Permana \n\ud83d\udd82 Corresponding author: Kartini Sikumbang \n \nEmail Address: kartinisikumbang86@gmail.com (Jl.

Putri, Nurwati, dan S. Media sosial juga \nmerupakan tempat media berkonsentrasi pada eksistensi penggunanya, menurut Van Dijk (Nasrullah, \n2015). Istilah \"media sosial\" sering digunakan untuk merujuk pada jenis media baru yang \nmemungkinkan orang berpartisipasi secara interaktif (Manning, 2014). Sekarang orang dapat \nberinteraksi satu sama lain dalam skala besar lebih mudah daripada sebelum \nnya karena munculnya teknologi digital dan seluler. Akibatnya, interaktivitas adalah inti dari \nfungsi media baru. Satu orang sekarang dapat berbicara dengan banyak orang, dan ada kemungkinan \numpan balik instan. Sekarang orang-orang dan pelanggan memiliki suara yang lebih banyak dan tidak \nteredam daripada sebelumnya. (Manning, 2014) \nSalah satu perkembangan internet adalah media sosial. Kamera smartphone yang bagus \nmemungkinkan banyak orang melakukan aktivitas baru yang menyenangkan; orang dapat dengan \nmudah mengambil gambar di mana pun dan kapan pun dan kemudian menguploadnya ke media \nsosial. Beberapa jenis media sosial yang paling populer adalah Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, Path, \ndan Path. Instagram adalah aplikasi berbagi foto di mana pengguna dapat mengambil foto, \nmenggunakan filter digital, dan membagikannya ke berbagai layanan jejaring sosial. \nHasil penelitian  sebuah perusahaan riset dan analisis dari Inggris Masyarakat Indonesia senang \nmenggunakan Instagram untuk mencari inspirasi, berbagi petualangan, dan mengikuti tren terbaru. \nKomunitas pertama di ponsel juga telah menghasilkan hasil bisnis yang signifikan bagi perusahaan \nbesar maupun kecil di Indonesia. Sembilan puluh tujuh persen pengguna Instagram selalu menuliskan \nkomentar dan menandai teman-teman mereka; dan sembilan puluh tujuh persen menggunakan mesin \npencari untuk mencari informasi lebih lanjut. (Prihatiningsih, 2017) \nMedia sosial bukan ruang pribadi melainkan ruang publik bagi remaja. Berdasarkan observasi \nmereka bisa menghabiskan waktu ber jam-jam untuk menggunakan media sosial, entah itu untuk \nmeng-upload atau berbagi gambar, foto, video, hanya sekedar melihat-lihat, berkomentar di akun \ntemannya.Penelitiian ini ingin mendeskripsikan kebutuhan bermedia yang didapat remaja pada media \nsosial instagram.   \nOrang-orang yang lahir dimulai dari tahun 2001 sampai tahun 2010 disebut juga dengan \ngenerasi Z. karakteristik generasi ini adalah mereka tumbuh ketika teknologi sudah berkembang pesat, \ndimana personal kompuer, ponsel pintar, internet dan juga perangkat gaming sudah lumrah \ndigunakan. Generasi Z banyak menghabiskan waktu untuk berselancar di internet, seperti di web dan \njuga sosial media. Generasi Z cenderung menyukai kegiatan di dalam rumah daripada bermain di luar \nruangan dan berinteraksi dengan orang banyak. Hal ini disebabkan oleh kebiasaannya menggunakan \nteknologi sehingga banyak yang kecanduan. Generasi Z juga dikenal sebagai generasi yang serba \ninstan. Menginginkan hasil yang instan dan menyebabkan kemunculan teknologi artificial intelligent \nyang dapat membuat semua hal menjadi mudah. Karena kecendrungannya akan sesuatu yang cepat, \nPeranan Media Sosial Instagram terhadap Interaksi Sosial dan Etika pada Generasi Z, Kartini Sikumbang, Widya \nRamadhina, Emi Riska Yani, Della Arika, Nazmi Hayati, Nur Aini Hasibuan, Bagus Gigih Permana \n              11031 \n \n \ngenerasi Z juga banyak menemukan cara baru yang lebih efisien dalam mengerjakan sesuatu yang \nmana hal ini juga merupakan inovasi baru yang lahir karena kebiasaan ini. (Zis et al., 2021) \nInstagram merupakan salah satu platform yang populer dan digunakan oleh hampir semua \ngenerasi Z. Gen Z cenderung menggunakan Instagram sebagai alat untuk membangun identitas \ndigital, personal branding, dan ruang untuk menjadi diri mereka sendiri. Mereka juga menikmati \nkonten yang menghibur, terlibat dalam aksi sosial, dan dapat mempersonalisasi identitas digital \nmereka melalui platform ini. \nBeberapa penelitian juga menyoroti bahwa Instagram memainkan peran dalam pembentukan \nidentitas diri Gen Z dan bahwa Gen Z memiliki hubungan kompleks dengan media sosial seperti \nInstagram. Dengan demikian, dapat dikatakan bahwa Instagram memengaruhi cara Gen Z memahami \ndiri mereka dan berinteraksi dengan dunia di sekitar mereka. \n \nMETODE  \nDi dalam penelitian ini, peneliti menggunakan metode kualitatif Menurut Bogdan dan Taylor \ndalam Moleong, penelitian kualitatif sebagai prosedur penelitian yang menghasilkan data deskriptif \nberupa kata-kata tertulis atau lisan dari orang-orang dan perilaku yang dapat diamati (Moleong, 2010). \nAdapun pendekatan yang digunakan dalam penelitian ini adalah pendekatan deskriptif Secara \nkeseluruhan teknik analisis data yang dilakukan diawali dengan pengumpulan data dengan cara kajian \ndokumen dan literature review, reduksi data dan memilah informasi sesuai dengan tujuan penelitian, \nserta pengambilan kesimpulan. Adapun untuk validasi data peneliti menggunakan cara trianggulasi \nTriangulasi dalam pengujian kredibilitas ini diartikan sebagai pengecekan data dari berbagai sumber \ndengan berbagai cara, dan berbagai waktu. Dengan demikian terdapat triangulasi sumber, triangulasi \nteknik pengumpulan data dan triangulasi waktu. \n \nHASIL DAN DISKUSI  \nInstagram \nInstagram berasal dari kata \"insta\" atau \"instan\" yang terinspirasi dari kamera polaroid yang \ndulunya terkenal dengan sebutan \"foto instan\". Instagram awalnya hanya berfungsi sebagai platform \nuntuk berbagi foto, tetapi seiring waktu, Instagram pun kini bisa dijadikan sebagai ajang untuk \nmembuat konten video, upload video, insta story, dan masih banyak yang lainnya. Instagram menjadi \nsangat populer dan memiliki jutaan pengguna di seluruh dunia karena seringnya memberikan fitur \nyang inovatif untuk para penggunanya. Pada tanggal 9 April 2012, Facebook mengakuisisi Instagram \nsenilai hampir $1 miliar. Saat ini, Instagram memiliki fitur-fitur seperti Profesional Dashboard, \nRecently Delete, Matikan Video dan Audio ketika Live, Live Room, Reel Remix, Security Check Up, \ndan Insta Story. (Agianto et al., 2020) \nDalam beberapa tahun terakhir, Instagram telah berkembang pesat dan menjadi platform media \nsosial yang populer, diikuti oleh berbagai kelompok pengguna, termasuk remaja, millennium muda, \n11032           \n                              Journal on Education, Volume 06, No. 02, Januari-Februari 2024, hal. 11029-11037 \n \ndan pelaku bisnis. Instagram pertama kali diluncurkan pada bulan Oktober 2010 oleh Kevin Systrom \ndan Mike Krieger sebagai aplikasi check-in mobile bernama Burbn, Inc.  \nInstagram memiliki 2 miliar pengguna aktif tiap bulannya, yang menjadikan instagram platform \nsosial media terbanyak berdasarkan jumlah penggunanya di dunia. Instagram banyak digunakan oleh \ngenerasi Z salah satunya adalah karena Instagram merupakan platform sosial media visual yang ideal \nuntuk menampilkan produk dan berbagai jenis konten multimedia, banyaknya fitur yang bisa \ndigunakan menjadi daya tarik tersendiri.  \nSaat ini instagram bukan lagi sebagai alat komunikasi, namun menjadi platform aktualisasi diri \nyang populer. Seiring dengan populernya instagram makin banyak pula bermunculan influencer, atau \nyang kerap disebut sebagai selebriti instagram. Mereka adalah yang memiliki banyak followers di \ninstagram dan banyak yang mengidolakan mereka. Bidang yang digeluti juga bermacam-macam, \nseperti beauty, makanan, fashion, pendidikan, story telling dan masih banyak lagi.  \nAkibat banyaknya influencer yang bermunculan juga turut berpengaruh pada interaksi sosial \nbagi generasi Z, karena kecendrungan generasi Z untuk menirukan apa yang dilihat. Sebagian besar \ngenerasi Z melek informasi, artinya adalah dapat memilah informasi yang benar dan tidak benar hal \nini dikarenakan teknologi yang sudah berkembang pesat dan generasi Z mampu mengoperasikannya \ndengan baik.  \nPenelitian menunjukkan bahwa Instagram memiliki pengaruh yang signifikan pada generasi Z. \nPlatform ini tidak hanya berfungsi sebagai media untuk berbagi foto dan video, tetapi juga telah \nmenjadi sarana penting bagi influencer dan selebriti internet untuk mempromosikan berbagai produk, \ntermasuk produk fashion. Generasi Z cenderung menghabiskan waktu yang signifikan untuk \nmengakses dan berinteraksi dengan konten di Instagram, sehingga endorsement dan promosi produk \noleh influencer dapat memengaruhi preferensi dan keputusan pembelian mereka. (Sumartono et al., \n2015) \nSelain itu, Instagram juga mempengaruhi pola komunikasi generasi Z, terutama melalui fitur \nDirect Message (DM), yang digunakan secara aktif untuk berinteraksi dengan idola mereka. Dengan \ndemikian, dapat disimpulkan bahwa Instagram memainkan peran penting dalam membentuk \npreferensi, keputusan pembelian, dan pola komunikasi generasi Z. \nBerhasilnya Instagram menjadi platform media sosial populer berkembang pesat ini disebabkan \noleh beberapa faktor, yaitu : \n1. Fungsi Mobile: Instagram merupakan platform social media yang berbasis aplikasi mobile, \nsehingga mudah digunakan dimana saja \n2. Fleksibilitas: Instagram memungkinkan pengguna untuk membagikan konten tanpa harus diedit \ndan rekayasa, sehingga memudahkan pembagian konten \n3. Visualisasi: Manusia memang lebih mudah untuk menyaring informasi melalui visual \ndibandingkan teks, sehingga marketing visual menjadi populer \n4.

Generasi Z cenderung \nterbuka terhadap berbagai informasi, namun juga rentan terhadap dampak negatif seperti kecanduan \ninternet dan kurangnya kedisiplinan. Sebuah penelitian juga menyoroti pengaruh intensitas \npenggunaan Instagram dan konformitas terhadap perilaku konsumtif di kalangan Generasi Z. Oleh \nkarena itu, penting untuk memahami dan mengelola pengaruh media sosial, termasuk Instagram, \nsecara bijaksana dalam kehidupan remaja Generasi Z. (Afandi, 2020) \nGenerasi Z \nGenerasi Z adalah kelompok demografis yang menggantikan Generasi Milenial dan sebelum \nGenerasi Alfa. Mereka lahir pada rentang tahun 1997 sampai dengan tahun 2012. Generasi Z dikenal \nsebagai generasi yang tumbuh dan berkembang pada era teknologi yang terus berkembang, sehingga \nteknologi dan media sosial menjadi bagian penting dari kehidupan mereka. Generasi Z memiliki \nkarakteristik yang berbeda dari generasi sebelumnya, seperti milenial, dengan kecenderungan untuk \nlebih sensitif terhadap isu-isu sosial dan lingkungan \nMereka juga sering dianggap memiliki mental yang lemah atau manja karena sensitif dengan \nperubahan, namun hal ini bukan berarti mereka lebih rentan terhadap masalah kesehatan mental \ndaripada generasi lain. \nGenerasi Z memiliki beberapa karakteristik, yaitu : \n1. kecendrungan terhadap teknologi dan media sosial. Hal ini disebabkan oleh mereka hidup di era \nteknologi yang sudah berkembang pesat, dan mereka cenderung menggunakan media sosial \nsecara aktif.  \n2. FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) yaitu takut ketinggalan tren yang ada. Hal ini tidak hanya berlaku \nuntuk tren yang ada tetapi juga takut ketinggalan oleh pencapaian orang lain. Sehingga hal ini \nmenyebabkan tingginya tingkat stress oleh generasi Z. \n3. Keterampilan sosial dan pola pikir terbuka: Generasi Z cenderung memiliki keterampilan sosial \nyang berbeda dan pola pikir terbuka, namun juga mungkin kesulitan dalam mengelola tekanan \ndan mengekspresikan ketidakpuasan mereka dengan cara yang berbeda, termasuk dengan \n11034           \n                              Journal on Education, Volume 06, No. 02, Januari-Februari 2024, hal. 11029-11037 \n \nmengeluh. \nPengaruh Instagram terhadap Interaksi Sosial Generasi Z  \nKegiatan sosial yang melibatkan pertemuan masih berlangsung di kalangan gen Z namun jika \ndibandingkan dengan generasi sebelumnya seperti milenial, dan boomer maka frekuensinya \nmengalami penurunan. Hal ini disebabkan oleh banyaknya gen Z yang lebih individualis dan \ncenderung menyukai ruang lingkup pertemanan yang kecil dan hanya yang sepemahaman olehnya \nsaja. \nSalah satu aspek penting dari kegiatan sosial Gen Z adalah peran mereka dalam aktivisme \ndaring. Mereka menggunakan media sosial dan Internet untuk menyuarakan pandangan mereka \ntentang isu-isu sosial dan politik. \nSelain daripada itu, berdasarkan survei yang dilakukan, mayoritas generasi Z dan milenial di \nIndonesia menunjukkan tingkat kesadaran dan kepedulian yang tinggi terhadap isu perubahan iklim. \nHasil survei Indikator Politik Indonesia bersama dengan Yayasan Indonesia Cerah menunjukkan \nbahwa tingkat kesadaran akan isu perubahan iklim sangat besar, dengan 82% responden generasi Z \ndan milenial menilai pemerintah harus berbuat lebih banyak untuk mengatasi masalah ini. Selain itu, \nsurvei lain juga menunjukkan bahwa sebanyak 77,4% anak muda di Indonesia tertarik dengan isu \nlingkungan hidup, dengan 81,1% responden juga beranggapan bahwa masalah perubahan iklim dalam \nkondisi darurat. Dengan demikian, dapat disimpulkan bahwa sebagian besar generasi Z di Indonesia \nmenunjukkan kepedulian yang tinggi terhadap isu perubahan iklim.  \nGenerasi Z juga dikenal berani untuk menyuarakan pendapat. Mereka sering dianggap memiliki \nkepekaan dan perhatian besar terhadap isu-isu kesehatan mental, serta diakui sebagai pembawa \nperubahan yang berani bermimpi, menyuarakan pendapat, dan mengambil tindakan. Meskipun \ndemikian, ada juga pandangan yang menyebutkan bahwa jarang ditemukan Generasi Z yang berani \nuntuk menyuarakan pendapatnya dalam mengkritik pemerintah, terutama di media sosial. \nGenerasi Z tumbuh dalam era saat mereka memiliki akses langsung ke berbagai informasi dan \nmemiliki kebebasan berpendapat di media sosia memberikan platform untuk diskusi yang lebih \nterbuka dan menciptakan pemahaman yang lebih mendalam tentang isu-isu tersebut, oleh sebab itu \nmereka \nlebih \nekspresif \ndan \nberani \nmenyuarakan \npendapat \ndan \nkritiknya.  \nGenerasi Z juga menunjukkan minat yang besar dalam kegiatan amal dan sukarela. Mereka terlibat \ndalam berbagai proyek sukarela dan kegiatan amal, baik di tingkat lokal maupun global. Kegiatan ini \nsering kali didokumentasikan dan dibagikan di media sosial untuk menginspirasi yang lain. \n(Khrishananto & Adriansyah, 2021) \nAdanya media sosial instagram juga merupakan salah satu promosi yang efektif untuk \nmelakukan campaign berupa relawan. Karena empati yang tinggi yang dimiliki oleh generasi Z maka \nbanyak kegiatan yang membutuhkan sukarelawan banyak diikuti oleh generasi Z.  \nGenerasi Z cenderung tertarik pada berbagai kegiatan volunteering yang dapat meningkatkan \nketerlibatan mereka dalam membuat perubahan positif.

Platform ini menawarkan berbagai fitur yang mendukung pengguna dalam menyebarkan konten, \nberinteraksi dengan teman, dan membangun jaringan sosial. Dalam beberapa tahun terakhir, Instagram telah \nmenjadi platform yang sangat populer di antara generasi Z. Platform ini menawarkan berbagai fitur yang \nmenarik, seperti penampilan video singkat (IGTV), berbagai format konten (carousel, album, dan video \nhybris), dan fitur interaktif seperti story dan interaksi dengan teman (like, komentar, dan share). Dengan \ndemikian, Instagram  menjadi tempat yang ideal untuk pemuda berinteraksi sosial dan menjajikan konten yang \nmenarik. Platform ini memungkinkan pengguna untuk menampilkan konten mereka secara kreatif dan \nmendapatkan interaksi dengan teman, baik secara langsung mengarah teman melalui komentar dan like, \nmaupun melalui fitur interaktif Instagram Stories. Dalam konteks ini, kita akan membahas bagaimana fitur-\nfitur Instagram mempengaruhi cara generasi Z berinteraksi sosial, serta bagaimana platform ini menjadi alat \nyang penting dalam kehidupan sehari-hari mereka. Selain itu, kita akan membahas bagaimana pengguna dapat \nmengoptimalkan pengalaman Instagram untuk meningkatkan interaksi sosial dan membangun jaringan yang \nkuat. Dalam hasil penelitian ini, kita akan membahas penggunaan Instagram oleh generasi Z dalam berbagai \naspek, mulai dari fitur yang digunakan hingga strategi pemasaran yang sukses. Dengan memahami peranan \nmedia sosial Instagram dalam interaksi sosial pada generasi Z, kita dapat menyimpulkan bahwa Instagram \nsangat berpotensi menjadi alat yang sangat penting dalam kehidupan dan kebangkitan generasi Z di dunia \ndigital. \nKata Kunci: Instagram, Generasi Z, Interaksi Sosial  \n \nCopyright (c) 2023 Kartini Sikumbang, Widya Ramadhina, Emi Riska Yani, Della Arika, Nazmi Hayati, Nur \nAini Hasibuan, Bagus Gigih Permana \n\ud83d\udd82 Corresponding author: Kartini Sikumbang \n \nEmail Address: kartinisikumbang86@gmail.com (Jl.

Putri, Nurwati, dan S. Media sosial juga \nmerupakan tempat media berkonsentrasi pada eksistensi penggunanya, menurut Van Dijk (Nasrullah, \n2015). Istilah \"media sosial\" sering digunakan untuk merujuk pada jenis media baru yang \nmemungkinkan orang berpartisipasi secara interaktif (Manning, 2014). Sekarang orang dapat \nberinteraksi satu sama lain dalam skala besar lebih mudah daripada sebelum \nnya karena munculnya teknologi digital dan seluler. Akibatnya, interaktivitas adalah inti dari \nfungsi media baru. Satu orang sekarang dapat berbicara dengan banyak orang, dan ada kemungkinan \numpan balik instan. Sekarang orang-orang dan pelanggan memiliki suara yang lebih banyak dan tidak \nteredam daripada sebelumnya. (Manning, 2014) \nSalah satu perkembangan internet adalah media sosial. Kamera smartphone yang bagus \nmemungkinkan banyak orang melakukan aktivitas baru yang menyenangkan; orang dapat dengan \nmudah mengambil gambar di mana pun dan kapan pun dan kemudian menguploadnya ke media \nsosial. Beberapa jenis media sosial yang paling populer adalah Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, Path, \ndan Path. Instagram adalah aplikasi berbagi foto di mana pengguna dapat mengambil foto, \nmenggunakan filter digital, dan membagikannya ke berbagai layanan jejaring sosial. \nHasil penelitian  sebuah perusahaan riset dan analisis dari Inggris Masyarakat Indonesia senang \nmenggunakan Instagram untuk mencari inspirasi, berbagi petualangan, dan mengikuti tren terbaru. \nKomunitas pertama di ponsel juga telah menghasilkan hasil bisnis yang signifikan bagi perusahaan \nbesar maupun kecil di Indonesia. Sembilan puluh tujuh persen pengguna Instagram selalu menuliskan \nkomentar dan menandai teman-teman mereka; dan sembilan puluh tujuh persen menggunakan mesin \npencari untuk mencari informasi lebih lanjut. (Prihatiningsih, 2017) \nMedia sosial bukan ruang pribadi melainkan ruang publik bagi remaja. Berdasarkan observasi \nmereka bisa menghabiskan waktu ber jam-jam untuk menggunakan media sosial, entah itu untuk \nmeng-upload atau berbagi gambar, foto, video, hanya sekedar melihat-lihat, berkomentar di akun \ntemannya.Penelitiian ini ingin mendeskripsikan kebutuhan bermedia yang didapat remaja pada media \nsosial instagram.   \nOrang-orang yang lahir dimulai dari tahun 2001 sampai tahun 2010 disebut juga dengan \ngenerasi Z. karakteristik generasi ini adalah mereka tumbuh ketika teknologi sudah berkembang pesat, \ndimana personal kompuer, ponsel pintar, internet dan juga perangkat gaming sudah lumrah \ndigunakan. Generasi Z banyak menghabiskan waktu untuk berselancar di internet, seperti di web dan \njuga sosial media. Generasi Z cenderung menyukai kegiatan di dalam rumah daripada bermain di luar \nruangan dan berinteraksi dengan orang banyak. Hal ini disebabkan oleh kebiasaannya menggunakan \nteknologi sehingga banyak yang kecanduan. Generasi Z juga dikenal sebagai generasi yang serba \ninstan. Menginginkan hasil yang instan dan menyebabkan kemunculan teknologi artificial intelligent \nyang dapat membuat semua hal menjadi mudah. Karena kecendrungannya akan sesuatu yang cepat, \nPeranan Media Sosial Instagram terhadap Interaksi Sosial dan Etika pada Generasi Z, Kartini Sikumbang, Widya \nRamadhina, Emi Riska Yani, Della Arika, Nazmi Hayati, Nur Aini Hasibuan, Bagus Gigih Permana \n              11031 \n \n \ngenerasi Z juga banyak menemukan cara baru yang lebih efisien dalam mengerjakan sesuatu yang \nmana hal ini juga merupakan inovasi baru yang lahir karena kebiasaan ini. (Zis et al., 2021) \nInstagram merupakan salah satu platform yang populer dan digunakan oleh hampir semua \ngenerasi Z. Gen Z cenderung menggunakan Instagram sebagai alat untuk membangun identitas \ndigital, personal branding, dan ruang untuk menjadi diri mereka sendiri. Mereka juga menikmati \nkonten yang menghibur, terlibat dalam aksi sosial, dan dapat mempersonalisasi identitas digital \nmereka melalui platform ini. \nBeberapa penelitian juga menyoroti bahwa Instagram memainkan peran dalam pembentukan \nidentitas diri Gen Z dan bahwa Gen Z memiliki hubungan kompleks dengan media sosial seperti \nInstagram. Dengan demikian, dapat dikatakan bahwa Instagram memengaruhi cara Gen Z memahami \ndiri mereka dan berinteraksi dengan dunia di sekitar mereka. \n \nMETODE  \nDi dalam penelitian ini, peneliti menggunakan metode kualitatif Menurut Bogdan dan Taylor \ndalam Moleong, penelitian kualitatif sebagai prosedur penelitian yang menghasilkan data deskriptif \nberupa kata-kata tertulis atau lisan dari orang-orang dan perilaku yang dapat diamati (Moleong, 2010). \nAdapun pendekatan yang digunakan dalam penelitian ini adalah pendekatan deskriptif Secara \nkeseluruhan teknik analisis data yang dilakukan diawali dengan pengumpulan data dengan cara kajian \ndokumen dan literature review, reduksi data dan memilah informasi sesuai dengan tujuan penelitian, \nserta pengambilan kesimpulan. Adapun untuk validasi data peneliti menggunakan cara trianggulasi \nTriangulasi dalam pengujian kredibilitas ini diartikan sebagai pengecekan data dari berbagai sumber \ndengan berbagai cara, dan berbagai waktu. Dengan demikian terdapat triangulasi sumber, triangulasi \nteknik pengumpulan data dan triangulasi waktu. \n \nHASIL DAN DISKUSI  \nInstagram \nInstagram berasal dari kata \"insta\" atau \"instan\" yang terinspirasi dari kamera polaroid yang \ndulunya terkenal dengan sebutan \"foto instan\". Instagram awalnya hanya berfungsi sebagai platform \nuntuk berbagi foto, tetapi seiring waktu, Instagram pun kini bisa dijadikan sebagai ajang untuk \nmembuat konten video, upload video, insta story, dan masih banyak yang lainnya. Instagram menjadi \nsangat populer dan memiliki jutaan pengguna di seluruh dunia karena seringnya memberikan fitur \nyang inovatif untuk para penggunanya. Pada tanggal 9 April 2012, Facebook mengakuisisi Instagram \nsenilai hampir $1 miliar. Saat ini, Instagram memiliki fitur-fitur seperti Profesional Dashboard, \nRecently Delete, Matikan Video dan Audio ketika Live, Live Room, Reel Remix, Security Check Up, \ndan Insta Story. (Agianto et al., 2020) \nDalam beberapa tahun terakhir, Instagram telah berkembang pesat dan menjadi platform media \nsosial yang populer, diikuti oleh berbagai kelompok pengguna, termasuk remaja, millennium muda, \n11032           \n                              Journal on Education, Volume 06, No. 02, Januari-Februari 2024, hal. 11029-11037 \n \ndan pelaku bisnis. Instagram pertama kali diluncurkan pada bulan Oktober 2010 oleh Kevin Systrom \ndan Mike Krieger sebagai aplikasi check-in mobile bernama Burbn, Inc.  \nInstagram memiliki 2 miliar pengguna aktif tiap bulannya, yang menjadikan instagram platform \nsosial media terbanyak berdasarkan jumlah penggunanya di dunia. Instagram banyak digunakan oleh \ngenerasi Z salah satunya adalah karena Instagram merupakan platform sosial media visual yang ideal \nuntuk menampilkan produk dan berbagai jenis konten multimedia, banyaknya fitur yang bisa \ndigunakan menjadi daya tarik tersendiri.  \nSaat ini instagram bukan lagi sebagai alat komunikasi, namun menjadi platform aktualisasi diri \nyang populer. Seiring dengan populernya instagram makin banyak pula bermunculan influencer, atau \nyang kerap disebut sebagai selebriti instagram. Mereka adalah yang memiliki banyak followers di \ninstagram dan banyak yang mengidolakan mereka. Bidang yang digeluti juga bermacam-macam, \nseperti beauty, makanan, fashion, pendidikan, story telling dan masih banyak lagi.  \nAkibat banyaknya influencer yang bermunculan juga turut berpengaruh pada interaksi sosial \nbagi generasi Z, karena kecendrungan generasi Z untuk menirukan apa yang dilihat. Sebagian besar \ngenerasi Z melek informasi, artinya adalah dapat memilah informasi yang benar dan tidak benar hal \nini dikarenakan teknologi yang sudah berkembang pesat dan generasi Z mampu mengoperasikannya \ndengan baik.  \nPenelitian menunjukkan bahwa Instagram memiliki pengaruh yang signifikan pada generasi Z. \nPlatform ini tidak hanya berfungsi sebagai media untuk berbagi foto dan video, tetapi juga telah \nmenjadi sarana penting bagi influencer dan selebriti internet untuk mempromosikan berbagai produk, \ntermasuk produk fashion. Generasi Z cenderung menghabiskan waktu yang signifikan untuk \nmengakses dan berinteraksi dengan konten di Instagram, sehingga endorsement dan promosi produk \noleh influencer dapat memengaruhi preferensi dan keputusan pembelian mereka. (Sumartono et al., \n2015) \nSelain itu, Instagram juga mempengaruhi pola komunikasi generasi Z, terutama melalui fitur \nDirect Message (DM), yang digunakan secara aktif untuk berinteraksi dengan idola mereka. Dengan \ndemikian, dapat disimpulkan bahwa Instagram memainkan peran penting dalam membentuk \npreferensi, keputusan pembelian, dan pola komunikasi generasi Z. \nBerhasilnya Instagram menjadi platform media sosial populer berkembang pesat ini disebabkan \noleh beberapa faktor, yaitu : \n1. Fungsi Mobile: Instagram merupakan platform social media yang berbasis aplikasi mobile, \nsehingga mudah digunakan dimana saja \n2. Fleksibilitas: Instagram memungkinkan pengguna untuk membagikan konten tanpa harus diedit \ndan rekayasa, sehingga memudahkan pembagian konten \n3. Visualisasi: Manusia memang lebih mudah untuk menyaring informasi melalui visual \ndibandingkan teks, sehingga marketing visual menjadi populer \n4. Format Persegi: Instagram menarik perhatian dengan format persegi yang nyaman untuk mata, \nPeranan Media Sosial Instagram terhadap Interaksi Sosial dan Etika pada Generasi Z, Kartini Sikumbang, Widya \nRamadhina, Emi Riska Yani, Della Arika, Nazmi Hayati, Nur Aini Hasibuan, Bagus Gigih Permana \n              11033 \n \n \nyang menarik audiens muda \n5. Fitur Inovatif: Instagram sering memberikan fitur yang inovatif untuk para pengguna, seperti \nberbagai tingkatan akses, pengalaman berbeda untuk pengguna berbagai usia, dan fitur yang \nmemungkinkan pengguna untuk menghubungkan dengan audiens yang luas \n6. Pemasaran dan Promosi: Instagram menjadi alat yang efektif untuk memasarkan produk dan \nlayanan, karena memiliki audiens yang luas dan berpotensi beli \n7. Integrasi dengan Instagram Stories: Instagram Stories memungkinkan pengguna untuk \nmengunggah foto dan video sementara dan mengizinkan mereka untuk menanggapi konten \nStories dengan mengirimkan foto dan lengkap dengan efek Instagram.  \nMedia sosial, termasuk Instagram, memiliki pengaruh yang signifikan bagi remaja Generasi Z. \nBeberapa dampaknya termasuk kemungkinan terlibat dalam cyber-bullying, kecanduan media sosial, \nperubahan gaya komunikasi, dan potensi terlibat dalam perilaku konsumtif. Generasi Z cenderung \nterbuka terhadap berbagai informasi, namun juga rentan terhadap dampak negatif seperti kecanduan \ninternet dan kurangnya kedisiplinan. Sebuah penelitian juga menyoroti pengaruh intensitas \npenggunaan Instagram dan konformitas terhadap perilaku konsumtif di kalangan Generasi Z. Oleh \nkarena itu, penting untuk memahami dan mengelola pengaruh media sosial, termasuk Instagram, \nsecara bijaksana dalam kehidupan remaja Generasi Z. (Afandi, 2020) \nGenerasi Z \nGenerasi Z adalah kelompok demografis yang menggantikan Generasi Milenial dan sebelum \nGenerasi Alfa. Mereka lahir pada rentang tahun 1997 sampai dengan tahun 2012. Generasi Z dikenal \nsebagai generasi yang tumbuh dan berkembang pada era teknologi yang terus berkembang, sehingga \nteknologi dan media sosial menjadi bagian penting dari kehidupan mereka.

(Istiani & Islamy, 2020) \nGenerasi Z memiliki hubungan yang kompleks dengan media sosial, terutama Instagram. \nMereka cenderung menggunakan Instagram sebagai platform favorit karena fokusnya pada konten \nvisual, yang memungkinkan mereka untuk berbagi foto dan video, mengikuti influencer, dan \nmengekspresikan diri melalui cerita dan postingan. Selain itu, media sosial, termasuk Instagram, juga \ndigunakan oleh Generasi Z sebagai sumber informasi dan berita, serta sebagai alat ekspresi diri. \nNamun, penelitian juga menunjukkan bahwa penggunaan media sosial, termasuk Instagram, dapat \nmemiliki dampak negatif pada kesehatan mental Generasi Z, dengan sebagian dari mereka \nmenghabiskan waktu yang cukup lama di platform tersebut. (Irwanto & Hariatiningsih, 2019) \n  \nKESIMPULAN  \nDalam jurnal ini, kita membahas peranan media sosial Instagram terhadap interaksi sosial pada \ngenerasi Z. Berikut ini adalah beberapa kesimpulan penting yang diperoleh dari penelitian: Instagram, \nsebagai salah satu platform media sosial yang populer, telah menjadi alat yang sangat efektif dalam \nmeningkatkan keterlibatan dan interaksi sosial pada generasi Z. Platform ini memungkinkan pengguna \nuntuk menyebarkan konten dan berkomunikasi dengan mudah, baik secara individu maupun \nbersamaan. Kedua, penggunaan Instagram telah mempengaruhi cara generasi Z dalam menjajaki \nhidup mereka, termasuk dalam aspek interaksi sosial. Platform ini menyediakan berbagai fitur yang \nmemungkinkan pengguna untuk menyejajikan detail kehidupan mereka, mendukung eksplorasi \nidentitas, dan membangun jaringan sosial yang lebih luas.

Additionally, \nwe'll discuss how users can optimize their Instagram experience to increase social interactions and build a \nstrong network. In the results of this research, we will discuss the use of Instagram by generation Z in various \naspects, from the features used to successful marketing strategies. By understanding the role of social media \nInstagram in social interaction in generation Z, we can conclude that Instagram has the potential to become a \nvery important tool in the life and rise of generation Z in the digital world. \nKeywords: Instagram, Generation Z, Social Interaction \nAbstrak \nInstagram adalah salah satu platform sosial media yang populer dan digunakan oleh banyak orang, termasuk \ngenerasi Z. Platform ini menawarkan berbagai fitur yang mendukung pengguna dalam menyebarkan konten, \nberinteraksi dengan teman, dan membangun jaringan sosial. Dalam beberapa tahun terakhir, Instagram telah \nmenjadi platform yang sangat populer di antara generasi Z. Platform ini menawarkan berbagai fitur yang \nmenarik, seperti penampilan video singkat (IGTV), berbagai format konten (carousel, album, dan video \nhybris), dan fitur interaktif seperti story dan interaksi dengan teman (like, komentar, dan share). Dengan \ndemikian, Instagram  menjadi tempat yang ideal untuk pemuda berinteraksi sosial dan menjajikan konten yang \nmenarik. Platform ini memungkinkan pengguna untuk menampilkan konten mereka secara kreatif dan \nmendapatkan interaksi dengan teman, baik secara langsung mengarah teman melalui komentar dan like, \nmaupun melalui fitur interaktif Instagram Stories. Dalam konteks ini, kita akan membahas bagaimana fitur-\nfitur Instagram mempengaruhi cara generasi Z berinteraksi sosial, serta bagaimana platform ini menjadi alat \nyang penting dalam kehidupan sehari-hari mereka. Selain itu, kita akan membahas bagaimana pengguna dapat \nmengoptimalkan pengalaman Instagram untuk meningkatkan interaksi sosial dan membangun jaringan yang \nkuat. Dalam hasil penelitian ini, kita akan membahas penggunaan Instagram oleh generasi Z dalam berbagai \naspek, mulai dari fitur yang digunakan hingga strategi pemasaran yang sukses. Dengan memahami peranan \nmedia sosial Instagram dalam interaksi sosial pada generasi Z, kita dapat menyimpulkan bahwa Instagram \nsangat berpotensi menjadi alat yang sangat penting dalam kehidupan dan kebangkitan generasi Z di dunia \ndigital. \nKata Kunci: Instagram, Generasi Z, Interaksi Sosial  \n \nCopyright (c) 2023 Kartini Sikumbang, Widya Ramadhina, Emi Riska Yani, Della Arika, Nazmi Hayati, Nur \nAini Hasibuan, Bagus Gigih Permana \n\ud83d\udd82 Corresponding author: Kartini Sikumbang \n \nEmail Address: kartinisikumbang86@gmail.com (Jl.

Putri, Nurwati, dan S. Media sosial juga \nmerupakan tempat media berkonsentrasi pada eksistensi penggunanya, menurut Van Dijk (Nasrullah, \n2015). Istilah \"media sosial\" sering digunakan untuk merujuk pada jenis media baru yang \nmemungkinkan orang berpartisipasi secara interaktif (Manning, 2014). Sekarang orang dapat \nberinteraksi satu sama lain dalam skala besar lebih mudah daripada sebelum \nnya karena munculnya teknologi digital dan seluler. Akibatnya, interaktivitas adalah inti dari \nfungsi media baru. Satu orang sekarang dapat berbicara dengan banyak orang, dan ada kemungkinan \numpan balik instan. Sekarang orang-orang dan pelanggan memiliki suara yang lebih banyak dan tidak \nteredam daripada sebelumnya. (Manning, 2014) \nSalah satu perkembangan internet adalah media sosial. Kamera smartphone yang bagus \nmemungkinkan banyak orang melakukan aktivitas baru yang menyenangkan; orang dapat dengan \nmudah mengambil gambar di mana pun dan kapan pun dan kemudian menguploadnya ke media \nsosial. Beberapa jenis media sosial yang paling populer adalah Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, Path, \ndan Path. Instagram adalah aplikasi berbagi foto di mana pengguna dapat mengambil foto, \nmenggunakan filter digital, dan membagikannya ke berbagai layanan jejaring sosial. \nHasil penelitian  sebuah perusahaan riset dan analisis dari Inggris Masyarakat Indonesia senang \nmenggunakan Instagram untuk mencari inspirasi, berbagi petualangan, dan mengikuti tren terbaru. \nKomunitas pertama di ponsel juga telah menghasilkan hasil bisnis yang signifikan bagi perusahaan \nbesar maupun kecil di Indonesia. Sembilan puluh tujuh persen pengguna Instagram selalu menuliskan \nkomentar dan menandai teman-teman mereka; dan sembilan puluh tujuh persen menggunakan mesin \npencari untuk mencari informasi lebih lanjut. (Prihatiningsih, 2017) \nMedia sosial bukan ruang pribadi melainkan ruang publik bagi remaja. Berdasarkan observasi \nmereka bisa menghabiskan waktu ber jam-jam untuk menggunakan media sosial, entah itu untuk \nmeng-upload atau berbagi gambar, foto, video, hanya sekedar melihat-lihat, berkomentar di akun \ntemannya.Penelitiian ini ingin mendeskripsikan kebutuhan bermedia yang didapat remaja pada media \nsosial instagram.   \nOrang-orang yang lahir dimulai dari tahun 2001 sampai tahun 2010 disebut juga dengan \ngenerasi Z. karakteristik generasi ini adalah mereka tumbuh ketika teknologi sudah berkembang pesat, \ndimana personal kompuer, ponsel pintar, internet dan juga perangkat gaming sudah lumrah \ndigunakan. Generasi Z banyak menghabiskan waktu untuk berselancar di internet, seperti di web dan \njuga sosial media. Generasi Z cenderung menyukai kegiatan di dalam rumah daripada bermain di luar \nruangan dan berinteraksi dengan orang banyak. Hal ini disebabkan oleh kebiasaannya menggunakan \nteknologi sehingga banyak yang kecanduan. Generasi Z juga dikenal sebagai generasi yang serba \ninstan. Menginginkan hasil yang instan dan menyebabkan kemunculan teknologi artificial intelligent \nyang dapat membuat semua hal menjadi mudah. Karena kecendrungannya akan sesuatu yang cepat, \nPeranan Media Sosial Instagram terhadap Interaksi Sosial dan Etika pada Generasi Z, Kartini Sikumbang, Widya \nRamadhina, Emi Riska Yani, Della Arika, Nazmi Hayati, Nur Aini Hasibuan, Bagus Gigih Permana \n              11031 \n \n \ngenerasi Z juga banyak menemukan cara baru yang lebih efisien dalam mengerjakan sesuatu yang \nmana hal ini juga merupakan inovasi baru yang lahir karena kebiasaan ini. (Zis et al., 2021) \nInstagram merupakan salah satu platform yang populer dan digunakan oleh hampir semua \ngenerasi Z. Gen Z cenderung menggunakan Instagram sebagai alat untuk membangun identitas \ndigital, personal branding, dan ruang untuk menjadi diri mereka sendiri. Mereka juga menikmati \nkonten yang menghibur, terlibat dalam aksi sosial, dan dapat mempersonalisasi identitas digital \nmereka melalui platform ini. \nBeberapa penelitian juga menyoroti bahwa Instagram memainkan peran dalam pembentukan \nidentitas diri Gen Z dan bahwa Gen Z memiliki hubungan kompleks dengan media sosial seperti \nInstagram. Dengan demikian, dapat dikatakan bahwa Instagram memengaruhi cara Gen Z memahami \ndiri mereka dan berinteraksi dengan dunia di sekitar mereka. \n \nMETODE  \nDi dalam penelitian ini, peneliti menggunakan metode kualitatif Menurut Bogdan dan Taylor \ndalam Moleong, penelitian kualitatif sebagai prosedur penelitian yang menghasilkan data deskriptif \nberupa kata-kata tertulis atau lisan dari orang-orang dan perilaku yang dapat diamati (Moleong, 2010). \nAdapun pendekatan yang digunakan dalam penelitian ini adalah pendekatan deskriptif Secara \nkeseluruhan teknik analisis data yang dilakukan diawali dengan pengumpulan data dengan cara kajian \ndokumen dan literature review, reduksi data dan memilah informasi sesuai dengan tujuan penelitian, \nserta pengambilan kesimpulan. Adapun untuk validasi data peneliti menggunakan cara trianggulasi \nTriangulasi dalam pengujian kredibilitas ini diartikan sebagai pengecekan data dari berbagai sumber \ndengan berbagai cara, dan berbagai waktu. Dengan demikian terdapat triangulasi sumber, triangulasi \nteknik pengumpulan data dan triangulasi waktu. \n \nHASIL DAN DISKUSI  \nInstagram \nInstagram berasal dari kata \"insta\" atau \"instan\" yang terinspirasi dari kamera polaroid yang \ndulunya terkenal dengan sebutan \"foto instan\". Instagram awalnya hanya berfungsi sebagai platform \nuntuk berbagi foto, tetapi seiring waktu, Instagram pun kini bisa dijadikan sebagai ajang untuk \nmembuat konten video, upload video, insta story, dan masih banyak yang lainnya. Instagram menjadi \nsangat populer dan memiliki jutaan pengguna di seluruh dunia karena seringnya memberikan fitur \nyang inovatif untuk para penggunanya. Pada tanggal 9 April 2012, Facebook mengakuisisi Instagram \nsenilai hampir $1 miliar. Saat ini, Instagram memiliki fitur-fitur seperti Profesional Dashboard, \nRecently Delete, Matikan Video dan Audio ketika Live, Live Room, Reel Remix, Security Check Up, \ndan Insta Story. (Agianto et al., 2020) \nDalam beberapa tahun terakhir, Instagram telah berkembang pesat dan menjadi platform media \nsosial yang populer, diikuti oleh berbagai kelompok pengguna, termasuk remaja, millennium muda, \n11032           \n                              Journal on Education, Volume 06, No. 02, Januari-Februari 2024, hal. 11029-11037 \n \ndan pelaku bisnis. Instagram pertama kali diluncurkan pada bulan Oktober 2010 oleh Kevin Systrom \ndan Mike Krieger sebagai aplikasi check-in mobile bernama Burbn, Inc.  \nInstagram memiliki 2 miliar pengguna aktif tiap bulannya, yang menjadikan instagram platform \nsosial media terbanyak berdasarkan jumlah penggunanya di dunia. Instagram banyak digunakan oleh \ngenerasi Z salah satunya adalah karena Instagram merupakan platform sosial media visual yang ideal \nuntuk menampilkan produk dan berbagai jenis konten multimedia, banyaknya fitur yang bisa \ndigunakan menjadi daya tarik tersendiri.  \nSaat ini instagram bukan lagi sebagai alat komunikasi, namun menjadi platform aktualisasi diri \nyang populer. Seiring dengan populernya instagram makin banyak pula bermunculan influencer, atau \nyang kerap disebut sebagai selebriti instagram. Mereka adalah yang memiliki banyak followers di \ninstagram dan banyak yang mengidolakan mereka. Bidang yang digeluti juga bermacam-macam, \nseperti beauty, makanan, fashion, pendidikan, story telling dan masih banyak lagi.  \nAkibat banyaknya influencer yang bermunculan juga turut berpengaruh pada interaksi sosial \nbagi generasi Z, karena kecendrungan generasi Z untuk menirukan apa yang dilihat. Sebagian besar \ngenerasi Z melek informasi, artinya adalah dapat memilah informasi yang benar dan tidak benar hal \nini dikarenakan teknologi yang sudah berkembang pesat dan generasi Z mampu mengoperasikannya \ndengan baik.  \nPenelitian menunjukkan bahwa Instagram memiliki pengaruh yang signifikan pada generasi Z. \nPlatform ini tidak hanya berfungsi sebagai media untuk berbagi foto dan video, tetapi juga telah \nmenjadi sarana penting bagi influencer dan selebriti internet untuk mempromosikan berbagai produk, \ntermasuk produk fashion. Generasi Z cenderung menghabiskan waktu yang signifikan untuk \nmengakses dan berinteraksi dengan konten di Instagram, sehingga endorsement dan promosi produk \noleh influencer dapat memengaruhi preferensi dan keputusan pembelian mereka. (Sumartono et al., \n2015) \nSelain itu, Instagram juga mempengaruhi pola komunikasi generasi Z, terutama melalui fitur \nDirect Message (DM), yang digunakan secara aktif untuk berinteraksi dengan idola mereka. Dengan \ndemikian, dapat disimpulkan bahwa Instagram memainkan peran penting dalam membentuk \npreferensi, keputusan pembelian, dan pola komunikasi generasi Z. \nBerhasilnya Instagram menjadi platform media sosial populer berkembang pesat ini disebabkan \noleh beberapa faktor, yaitu : \n1. Fungsi Mobile: Instagram merupakan platform social media yang berbasis aplikasi mobile, \nsehingga mudah digunakan dimana saja \n2. Fleksibilitas: Instagram memungkinkan pengguna untuk membagikan konten tanpa harus diedit \ndan rekayasa, sehingga memudahkan pembagian konten \n3. Visualisasi: Manusia memang lebih mudah untuk menyaring informasi melalui visual \ndibandingkan teks, sehingga marketing visual menjadi populer \n4. Format Persegi: Instagram menarik perhatian dengan format persegi yang nyaman untuk mata, \nPeranan Media Sosial Instagram terhadap Interaksi Sosial dan Etika pada Generasi Z, Kartini Sikumbang, Widya \nRamadhina, Emi Riska Yani, Della Arika, Nazmi Hayati, Nur Aini Hasibuan, Bagus Gigih Permana \n              11033 \n \n \nyang menarik audiens muda \n5. Fitur Inovatif: Instagram sering memberikan fitur yang inovatif untuk para pengguna, seperti \nberbagai tingkatan akses, pengalaman berbeda untuk pengguna berbagai usia, dan fitur yang \nmemungkinkan pengguna untuk menghubungkan dengan audiens yang luas \n6. Pemasaran dan Promosi: Instagram menjadi alat yang efektif untuk memasarkan produk dan \nlayanan, karena memiliki audiens yang luas dan berpotensi beli \n7. Integrasi dengan Instagram Stories: Instagram Stories memungkinkan pengguna untuk \nmengunggah foto dan video sementara dan mengizinkan mereka untuk menanggapi konten \nStories dengan mengirimkan foto dan lengkap dengan efek Instagram.  \nMedia sosial, termasuk Instagram, memiliki pengaruh yang signifikan bagi remaja Generasi Z. \nBeberapa dampaknya termasuk kemungkinan terlibat dalam cyber-bullying, kecanduan media sosial, \nperubahan gaya komunikasi, dan potensi terlibat dalam perilaku konsumtif. Generasi Z cenderung \nterbuka terhadap berbagai informasi, namun juga rentan terhadap dampak negatif seperti kecanduan \ninternet dan kurangnya kedisiplinan. Sebuah penelitian juga menyoroti pengaruh intensitas \npenggunaan Instagram dan konformitas terhadap perilaku konsumtif di kalangan Generasi Z. Oleh \nkarena itu, penting untuk memahami dan mengelola pengaruh media sosial, termasuk Instagram, \nsecara bijaksana dalam kehidupan remaja Generasi Z. (Afandi, 2020) \nGenerasi Z \nGenerasi Z adalah kelompok demografis yang menggantikan Generasi Milenial dan sebelum \nGenerasi Alfa. Mereka lahir pada rentang tahun 1997 sampai dengan tahun 2012. Generasi Z dikenal \nsebagai generasi yang tumbuh dan berkembang pada era teknologi yang terus berkembang, sehingga \nteknologi dan media sosial menjadi bagian penting dari kehidupan mereka. Generasi Z memiliki \nkarakteristik yang berbeda dari generasi sebelumnya, seperti milenial, dengan kecenderungan untuk \nlebih sensitif terhadap isu-isu sosial dan lingkungan \nMereka juga sering dianggap memiliki mental yang lemah atau manja karena sensitif dengan \nperubahan, namun hal ini bukan berarti mereka lebih rentan terhadap masalah kesehatan mental \ndaripada generasi lain. \nGenerasi Z memiliki beberapa karakteristik, yaitu : \n1. kecendrungan terhadap teknologi dan media sosial. Hal ini disebabkan oleh mereka hidup di era \nteknologi yang sudah berkembang pesat, dan mereka cenderung menggunakan media sosial \nsecara aktif.  \n2. FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) yaitu takut ketinggalan tren yang ada. Hal ini tidak hanya berlaku \nuntuk tren yang ada tetapi juga takut ketinggalan oleh pencapaian orang lain. Sehingga hal ini \nmenyebabkan tingginya tingkat stress oleh generasi Z. \n3. Keterampilan sosial dan pola pikir terbuka: Generasi Z cenderung memiliki keterampilan sosial \nyang berbeda dan pola pikir terbuka, namun juga mungkin kesulitan dalam mengelola tekanan \ndan mengekspresikan ketidakpuasan mereka dengan cara yang berbeda, termasuk dengan \n11034           \n                              Journal on Education, Volume 06, No. 02, Januari-Februari 2024, hal. 11029-11037 \n \nmengeluh. \nPengaruh Instagram terhadap Interaksi Sosial Generasi Z  \nKegiatan sosial yang melibatkan pertemuan masih berlangsung di kalangan gen Z namun jika \ndibandingkan dengan generasi sebelumnya seperti milenial, dan boomer maka frekuensinya \nmengalami penurunan. Hal ini disebabkan oleh banyaknya gen Z yang lebih individualis dan \ncenderung menyukai ruang lingkup pertemanan yang kecil dan hanya yang sepemahaman olehnya \nsaja. \nSalah satu aspek penting dari kegiatan sosial Gen Z adalah peran mereka dalam aktivisme \ndaring. Mereka menggunakan media sosial dan Internet untuk menyuarakan pandangan mereka \ntentang isu-isu sosial dan politik. \nSelain daripada itu, berdasarkan survei yang dilakukan, mayoritas generasi Z dan milenial di \nIndonesia menunjukkan tingkat kesadaran dan kepedulian yang tinggi terhadap isu perubahan iklim. \nHasil survei Indikator Politik Indonesia bersama dengan Yayasan Indonesia Cerah menunjukkan \nbahwa tingkat kesadaran akan isu perubahan iklim sangat besar, dengan 82% responden generasi Z \ndan milenial menilai pemerintah harus berbuat lebih banyak untuk mengatasi masalah ini. Selain itu, \nsurvei lain juga menunjukkan bahwa sebanyak 77,4% anak muda di Indonesia tertarik dengan isu \nlingkungan hidup, dengan 81,1% responden juga beranggapan bahwa masalah perubahan iklim dalam \nkondisi darurat. Dengan demikian, dapat disimpulkan bahwa sebagian besar generasi Z di Indonesia \nmenunjukkan kepedulian yang tinggi terhadap isu perubahan iklim.  \nGenerasi Z juga dikenal berani untuk menyuarakan pendapat. Mereka sering dianggap memiliki \nkepekaan dan perhatian besar terhadap isu-isu kesehatan mental, serta diakui sebagai pembawa \nperubahan yang berani bermimpi, menyuarakan pendapat, dan mengambil tindakan. Meskipun \ndemikian, ada juga pandangan yang menyebutkan bahwa jarang ditemukan Generasi Z yang berani \nuntuk menyuarakan pendapatnya dalam mengkritik pemerintah, terutama di media sosial. \nGenerasi Z tumbuh dalam era saat mereka memiliki akses langsung ke berbagai informasi dan \nmemiliki kebebasan berpendapat di media sosia memberikan platform untuk diskusi yang lebih \nterbuka dan menciptakan pemahaman yang lebih mendalam tentang isu-isu tersebut, oleh sebab itu \nmereka \nlebih \nekspresif \ndan \nberani \nmenyuarakan \npendapat \ndan \nkritiknya.  \nGenerasi Z juga menunjukkan minat yang besar dalam kegiatan amal dan sukarela. Mereka terlibat \ndalam berbagai proyek sukarela dan kegiatan amal, baik di tingkat lokal maupun global. Kegiatan ini \nsering kali didokumentasikan dan dibagikan di media sosial untuk menginspirasi yang lain. \n(Khrishananto & Adriansyah, 2021) \nAdanya media sosial instagram juga merupakan salah satu promosi yang efektif untuk \nmelakukan campaign berupa relawan. Karena empati yang tinggi yang dimiliki oleh generasi Z maka \nbanyak kegiatan yang membutuhkan sukarelawan banyak diikuti oleh generasi Z.  \nGenerasi Z cenderung tertarik pada berbagai kegiatan volunteering yang dapat meningkatkan \nketerlibatan mereka dalam membuat perubahan positif. Beberapa kegiatan volunteering yang cocok \nPeranan Media Sosial Instagram terhadap Interaksi Sosial dan Etika pada Generasi Z, Kartini Sikumbang, Widya \nRamadhina, Emi Riska Yani, Della Arika, Nazmi Hayati, Nur Aini Hasibuan, Bagus Gigih Permana \n              11035 \n \n \nuntuk Gen Z termasuk : \n1. Konservasi lingkungan: Melibatkan diri dalam kegiatan yang bertujuan menjaga kelestarian \nlingkungan dan alam. \n2. Pemberdayaan masyarakat: Menjadi relawan untuk program-program pemberdayaan dan \nkesejahteraan masyarakat. \n3. Pendidikan: Terlibat dalam kegiatan relawan sebagai guru atau mentor untuk anak-anak. \n4. Kegiatan virtual: Menjadi relawan virtual dalam berbagai bidang, seperti administrasi, pemasaran, \npengumpulan dana, dan penerjemahan.  \nGenerasi Z menghadapi beberapa kekhawatiran akibat penggunaan Instagram. Salah satunya \nadalah dampak negatif terhadap kesehatan mental. Menurut laporan dari Jurnal Kesehatan Anak dan \nRemaja, penggunaan media sosial seperti Instagram telah dikaitkan dengan peningkatan risiko \ndepresi, kecemasan, dan gangguan makan pada remaja. Selain itu, kecanduan media sosial juga \nmenjadi perhatian, dengan penelitian yang menunjukkan bahwa penggunaan berlebihan dapat \nberdampak negatif pada kesejahteraan psikologis. Selain itu, kekhawatiran tentang citra tubuh dan \ntekanan untuk menampilkan kehidupan yang sempurna juga merupakan masalah yang sering muncul \ndi kalangan pengguna Instagram. (Sumartono et al., 2015) \nDalam survei Global Gen Z yang dilakukan pada tahun 2022, McKinsey mensurvei lebih dari \n42 miliar responden di 16 negara. Mereka ditanyai tentang topik mental, fisik, sosial, dan spiritual. \nKerugian pertama adalah dampak negatif dari media sosial. Gen Z tampaknya memiliki distribusi \ndampak positif dan negatif yang relatif sama (32% dan 27%), berbeda dengan generasi sebelumnya \nyang memiliki distribusi dampak positif yang relatif lebih besar (37%). Sebagai contoh, mitokondria \nmemiliki 36% dampak positif dibandingkan dengan 19% dampak negatif. Generasi baby boomer \nterdiri dari sekitar 34% dan 9% dari populasi, dibandingkan dengan Gen X yang hanya 35% dan 14%. \n(Erlianti, 2020) \nSurvei McKinsey Health Institute menemukan bahwa Gen Z merupakan kelompok yang paling \nsering menggunakan media sosial dan melaporkan keadaan kesehatan mental yang buruk, dengan \n21% dari mereka di Indonesia melaporkan kondisi tersebut. Selain daripada itu, akibat dari \npenggunaan teknologi yang berlebihan dapat mendorong generasi Z kehilangan kemampuan untuk \nberinteraks dan bersosialisasi secara langsung.  \nBerbagai faktor mempengaruhi perilaku anti-sosial pada Generasi Z, antara lain: \n1. Faktor internal: Emosi, intelegensi, kesehatan, jenis kelamin, dan kedudukan dalam keluarga \ndapat mempengaruhi terjadinya perilaku anti-sosial \n2. Pengaruh teknologi: Generasi Z, yang lahir dalam rentang tahun kelahiran 1995-2010, telah \nterpapar kemajuan teknologi sejak lahir, sehingga mereka memiliki ketergantungan yang tinggi \npada teknologi dan internet \n3. Penggunaan teknologi khususnya smartphone dapat mendorong kehilangan kemampuan untuk \nberinteraksi dan bersosialisasi secara tatap \n11036           \n                              Journal on Education, Volume 06, No. 02, Januari-Februari 2024, hal. 11029-11037 \n \n4. Faktor eksternal: Kondisi eksternal, seperti adanya media yang intens, pengaruh sosial budaya \nyang sifatnya unik terhadap individu, dan ketegangan antara kebudayaan dan struktursosial, dapat \nmengakibatkan perilaku yang menyimpang \n5. Pendidikan dan kesempatan: Generasi Z mengalami perubahan dalam pendidikan dengan \nmenggunakan teknologi seperti e-learning atau blended learning, yang mungkin mempengaruhi \nperilaku anti-sosial. (Istiani & Islamy, 2020) \nGenerasi Z memiliki hubungan yang kompleks dengan media sosial, terutama Instagram. \nMereka cenderung menggunakan Instagram sebagai platform favorit karena fokusnya pada konten \nvisual, yang memungkinkan mereka untuk berbagi foto dan video, mengikuti influencer, dan \nmengekspresikan diri melalui cerita dan postingan. Selain itu, media sosial, termasuk Instagram, juga \ndigunakan oleh Generasi Z sebagai sumber informasi dan berita, serta sebagai alat ekspresi diri. \nNamun, penelitian juga menunjukkan bahwa penggunaan media sosial, termasuk Instagram, dapat \nmemiliki dampak negatif pada kesehatan mental Generasi Z, dengan sebagian dari mereka \nmenghabiskan waktu yang cukup lama di platform tersebut. (Irwanto & Hariatiningsih, 2019) \n  \nKESIMPULAN  \nDalam jurnal ini, kita membahas peranan media sosial Instagram terhadap interaksi sosial pada \ngenerasi Z. Berikut ini adalah beberapa kesimpulan penting yang diperoleh dari penelitian: Instagram, \nsebagai salah satu platform media sosial yang populer, telah menjadi alat yang sangat efektif dalam \nmeningkatkan keterlibatan dan interaksi sosial pada generasi Z. Platform ini memungkinkan pengguna \nuntuk menyebarkan konten dan berkomunikasi dengan mudah, baik secara individu maupun \nbersamaan. Kedua, penggunaan Instagram telah mempengaruhi cara generasi Z dalam menjajaki \nhidup mereka, termasuk dalam aspek interaksi sosial. Platform ini menyediakan berbagai fitur yang \nmemungkinkan pengguna untuk menyejajikan detail kehidupan mereka, mendukung eksplorasi \nidentitas, dan membangun jaringan sosial yang lebih luas. Ketiga, dalam konteks penelitian yang \ndiberikan, kita mengidentifikasi beberapa fitur Instagram yang mempengaruhi interaksi sosial pada \ngenerasi Z, seperti photo tagging, geotagging, dan interaksi komentar. Kita menemukan bahwa fitur-\nfitur ini mempengaruhi cara pengguna berinteraksi satu sama lain dan meningkatkan keterlibatan \nmereka dalam platform. Keempat, beberapa strategi penetapan yang dapat diambil Instagram untuk \nmeningkatkan interaksi sosial meliputi penggunaan potongan video dan berbagai fitur yang \nmemungkinkan pengguna untuk berkomunikasi secara lebih interaktif dan menjawab keterlibatan \npengguna lain. Kelima, dalam beberapa kasus, kita melihat bagaimana fitur Instagram, seperti \ngeotagging dan photo tagging, memungkinkan pengguna untuk mengembangkan jaringan sosial dan \nmendukung eksplorasi identitas mereka, baik dalam ruang publik maupun pribadi. \nSecara keseluruhan, penelitian ini menunjukkan bahwa Instagram memiliki peranan penting \ndalam interaksi sosial pada generasi Z dan menawarkan peluang untuk peningkatan keterlibatan dan \nberinteraksi satu sama lain melalui fitur yang menarik dan inovatif yang ditawarkan oleh platform. \nPeranan Media Sosial Instagram terhadap Interaksi Sosial dan Etika pada Generasi Z, Kartini Sikumbang, Widya \nRamadhina, Emi Riska Yani, Della Arika, Nazmi Hayati, Nur Aini Hasibuan, Bagus Gigih Permana \n              11037 \n \n \nREFERENSI \nAfandi, I.

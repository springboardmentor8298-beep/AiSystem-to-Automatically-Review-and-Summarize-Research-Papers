    "summary": "NnU-Net surpasses most specialised deep learning pipelines in 19 public international competitions and sets a new state of the art in the majority of the 49 tasks. The results demonstrate a vast hidden potential in the systematic adaptation of deep learning methods to different datasets. We make nnu-Net publicly available as an open-source tool that can effectively be used out-of-the-box, rendering state-of the-art segmentationaccessible to non-experts and catalyzing scientiﬁc progress as a framework forautomated method design.

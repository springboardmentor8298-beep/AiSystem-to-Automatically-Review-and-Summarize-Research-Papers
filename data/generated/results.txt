results at the top of
its list. users tend to interact most with the top results and pay little attention to those further down
the list [92]. the interactions of users with items will then be collected by the web search engine,
and the data will be used to make future decisions on how information should be presented based
on popularity and user interest. as a result, results at the top will become more and more popular,
not because of the nature of the result but due to the biased interaction and placement of results by
these algorithms [92]. the loop capturing this feedback between biases in data, algorithms, and user

interaction is illustrated in figure 1. we use this loop to categorize definitions of bias in the section
below.
3.1
types of bias
bias can exist in many shapes and forms, some of which can lead to unfairness in different down-
stream learning tasks. in [144], authors talk about sources of bias in machine learning with their
categorizations and descriptions in order to motivate future solutions to each of the sources of bias
introduced in the paper. in [120], the authors prepare a complete list of different types of biases with
their corresponding definitions that exist in different cycles from data origins to its collection and its
processing. here we will reiterate the most important sources of bias introduced in these two papers
and also add in some work from other existing research papers. additionally, we will introduce a
different categorization of these definitions in the paper according to the data, algorithm, and user
interaction loop.
3.1.1
data to algorithm. in this section we talk about biases in data, which, when used by ml
training algorithms, might result in biased algorithmic outcomes.
(1) measurement bias. measurement, or reporting, bias arises from how we choose, utilize,
and measure particular features [144]. an example of this type of bias was observed in the
recidivism risk prediction tool compas, where prior arrests and friend/family arrests were
used as proxy variables to measure level of “riskiness” or “crime”—-which on its own can
be viewed as mismeasured proxies. this is partly due to the fact that minority communities
are controlled and policed more frequently, so they have higher arrest rates. however, one
should not conclude that because people coming from minority groups have higher arrest rates
therefore they are more dangerous as there is a difference in how these groups are assessed
and controlled [144].
(2) omitted variable bias. omitted variable bias4 occurs when one or more important variables
are left out of the model [38, 114, 131]. an example for this case would be when someone
a survey on bias and fairness in machine learning
5
designs a model to predict, with relatively high accuracy, the annual percentage rate at which
customers will stop subscribing to a service, but soon observes that the majority of users are
canceling their subscription without receiving any warning from the designed model. now
imagine that the reason for canceling the subscriptions is appearance of a new strong competitor
in the market which offers the same solution, but for half the price. the appearance of the
competitor was something that the model was not ready for; therefore, it is considered to be an
omitted variable.
(3) representation bias. representation bias arises from how we sample from a population
during data collection process [144]. non-representative samples lack the diversity of the
population, with missing subgroups and other anomalies. lack of geographical diversity in
datasets like imagenet (as shown in figures 3 and 4) results in demonstrable bias towards
western cultures.
(4) aggregation bias. aggregation bias (or ecological fallacy) arises when false conclusions are
drawn about individuals from observing the entire population. an example of this type of
bias can be seen in clinical aid tools. consider diabetes patients who have apparent morbidity
differences across ethnicities and genders. specifically, hba1c levels, that are widely used
to diagnose and monitor diabetes, differ in complex ways across genders and ethnicities.
therefore, a model that ignores individual differences will likely not be well-suited for all
ethnic and gender groups in the population [144]. this is true even when they are represented
equally in the training data. any general assumptions about subgroups within the population
can result in aggregation bias.

fig. 2. illustration of biases in data. the red line shows the regression (mlr) for the entire population,
while dashed green lines are regressions for each subgroup, and the solid green line is the unbiased
regression. (a) when all subgroups are of equal size, then mlr shows a positive relationship between
the outcome and the independent variable. (b) regression shows almost no relationship in less
balanced data. the relationships between variables within each subgroup, however, remain the same.

(a) simpson’s paradox. simpson’s paradox is a type of aggregation bias that arises in the
analysis of heterogeneous data [18]. the paradox arises when an association observed
in aggregated data disappears or reverses when the same data is disaggregated into its
underlying subgroups (fig. 2(a)). one of the better-known examples of the type of paradox
arose during the gender bias lawsuit in university admissions against uc berkeley [16]. after
analyzing graduate school admissions data, it seemed like there was bias toward women,
a smaller fraction of whom were being admitted to graduate programs compared to their
male counterparts. however, when admissions data was separated and analyzed over the
departments, women applicants had equality and in some cases even a small advantage

over men. the paradox happened as women tended to apply to departments with lower
admission rates for both genders. simpson’s paradox has been observed in a variety of
domains, including biology [37], psychology [81], astronomy [109], and computational
social science [91].
(b) modifiable areal unit problem is a statistical bias in geospatial analysis, which arises
when modeling data at different levels of spatial aggregation [56]. this bias results in
different trends learned when data is aggregated at different spatial scales.
(5) sampling bias. sampling bias is similar to representation bias, and it arises due to non-
random sampling of subgroups. as a consequence of sampling bias, the trends estimated for
one population may not generalize to data collected from a new population. for the intuition,
consider the example in figure 2. the left plot represents data collected during a study from
three subgroups, which were uniformly sampled (fig. 2(a)). suppose the next time the study
was conducted, one of the subgroups was sampled more frequently than the rest (fig. 2(b)). the
positive trend found by the regression model in the first study almost completely disappears
(solid red line in plot on the right), although the subgroup trends (dashed green lines) are
unaffected.
(6) longitudinal data fallacy. researchers analyzing temporal data must use longitudinal anal-
ysis to track cohorts over time to learn their behavior. instead, temporal data is often modeled
a survey on bias and fairness in machine learning
7
using cross-sectional analysis, which combines diverse cohorts at a single time point. the
heterogeneous cohorts can bias cross-sectional analysis, leading to different conclusions than
longitudinal analysis. as an example, analysis of bulk reddit data [10] revealed that comment
length decreased over time on average. however, bulk data represented a cross-sectional
snapshot of the population, which in reality contained different cohorts who joined reddit
in different years. when data was disaggregated by cohorts, the comment length within each
cohort was found to increase over time.
(7) linking bias. linking bias arises when network attributes obtained from user connections,
activities, or interactions differ and misrepresent the true behavior of the users [120]. in
[104] authors show how social networks can be biased toward low-degree nodes when only
considering the links in the network and not considering the content and behavior of users in
the network. [153] also shows that user interactions are significantly different from social link
patterns that are based on features, such as

despite great progress in simulating multiphysics problems using
the numerical discretization of partial differential equations (pdes),
one still cannot seamlessly incorporate noisy data into existing
algorithms, mesh generation remains complex, and high-
dimensional problems governed by parameterized pdes cannot be
tackled. moreover, solving inverse problems with hidden physics is
often prohibitively expensive and requires different formulations and
elaborate computer codes. machine learning has emerged as a
promising alternative, but training deep neural networks requires big
data, not always available for scientific problems. instead, such
networks can be trained from additional information obtained by
enforcing the physical laws (for example, at random points in the
continuous space-time domain). such physics-informed learning
integrates (noisy) data and mathematical models, and implements
them through neural networks or other kernel-based regression
networks. moreover, it may be possible to design specialized
network architectures that automatically satisfy some of the physical
invariants for better accuracy, faster training and improved
generalization. furthermore, we review some of the prevailing
trends in embedding physics into machine learning, present some of
the current capabilities and limitations and discuss diverse
applications of physics-informed learning both for forward and
inverse problems, including discovering hidden physics and tackling
high-dimensional problems.

the problem is suﬃciently well-studied and validated in real applications that we trust the system’s
decision, even if the system is not perfect.
so when is explanation necessary and appropriate? we argue that the need for interpretability
stems from an incompleteness in the problem formalization, creating a fundamental barrier to
optimization and evaluation.
note that incompleteness is distinct from uncertainty: the fused
estimate of a missile location may be uncertain, but such uncertainty can be rigorously quantiﬁed
and formally reasoned about.
in machine learning terms, we distinguish between cases where
unknowns result in quantiﬁed variance—e.g. trying to learn from small data set or with limited
sensors—and incompleteness that produces some kind of unquantiﬁed bias—e.g.
the eﬀect of
including domain knowledge in a model selection process. below are some illustrative scenarios:
• scientiﬁc understanding: the human’s goal is to gain knowledge. we do not have a complete
way of stating what knowledge is; thus the best we can do is ask for explanations we can
convert into knowledge.
• safety: for complex tasks, the end-to-end system is almost never completely testable; one
cannot create a complete list of scenarios in which the system may fail. enumerating all
possible outputs given all possible inputs be computationally or logistically infeasible, and we
may be unable to ﬂag all undesirable outputs.
• ethics: the human may want to guard against certain kinds of discrimination, and their
notion of fairness may be too

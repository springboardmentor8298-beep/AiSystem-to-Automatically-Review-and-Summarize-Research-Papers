SYNTHESIZED SECTION
===================

the differences and biases in the networks can be a result of many factors, such as network sampling, as shown in [59, 111], which can change the network measures and cause different types of problems. any biases in algorithms might introduce biases in user behavior. in this section we talk about biases that are as a result of algorithmic outcomes and affect user behavior as a consequence. algorithmic bias is when the bias is not present in the input data and is added purely by the algorithm [9]. the algorithmic design choices, such as use of certain optimization functions, regularizations, choices in applying regression models on the data as a whole or considering subgroups, and the general use of statistically biased estimators in algorithms [44], can all contribute to biased algorithmic decisions that can bias the outcome of the algorithms. user interaction bias is a type of bias that can not only be observant on the web but also get triggered from two sources—the user interface and through the user itself by imposing his/her self-selected biased behavior and interaction [9]. this type of bias can be influenced by other types and subtypes, such as presentation and ranking biases. presentation bias is a result of how information is presented [9]. for example, on the web users can only click on content that they see, so the seen content gets clicks, while everything else gets no click. and it could be the case that the user does not see all the information on the web [9].

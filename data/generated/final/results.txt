SYNTHESIZED SECTION
===================

users tend to interact most with the top results and pay little attention to those further down the list [92]. the interactions of users with items will then be collected by the web search engine, and the data will be used to make future decisions on how information should be presented based on popularity and user interest. as a result, results at the top will become more and more popular, not because of the nature of the result but due to the biased interaction and placement of results by these algorithms [92]. the loop capturing this feedback between biases in data, algorithms, and user 4 mehrabi et al. data algorithm user interaction behavioral bias content production bias ranking bias emergent bias aggregation bias longitudinal data fallacy fig. examples of bias definitions placed in the data, algorithm, and user interaction feedback loop. we use this loop to categorize definitions of bias in the section below. 3.1 types of bias bias can exist in many shapes and forms, some of which can lead to unfairness in different down- stream learning tasks. in [144], authors talk about sources of bias in machine learning with their categorizations and descriptions in order to motivate future solutions to each of the sources of bias introduced in the paper. in [120], the authors prepare a complete list of different types of biases with their corresponding definitions that exist in different cycles from data origins to its collection and its processing.

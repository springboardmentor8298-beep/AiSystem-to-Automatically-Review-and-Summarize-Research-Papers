conclusion in this survey we introduced problems that can adversely affect ai systems in terms of bias and unfairness. the issues were viewed primarily from two dimensions: data and algorithms. we illus- trated problems that demonstrate why fairness is an important issue. we further showed examples of 26 mehrabi et al. the potential real-world harm that unfairness can have on society—such as applications in judicial systems, face recognition, and promoting algorithms. we then went over the definitions of fairness and bias that have been proposed by researchers. to further stimulate the interest of readers, we provided some of the work done in different areas in terms of addressing the biases that may affect ai systems and different methods and domains in ai, such as general machine learning, deep learning and natural language processing. we then further subdivided the fields into a more fine-grained analysis of each subdomain and the work being done to address fairness constraints in each. the hope is to expand the horizons of the readers to think deeply while working on a system or a method to ensure that it has a low likelihood of causing potential harm or bias toward a particular group. with the expansion of ai use in our world, it is important that researchers take this issue seriously and expand their knowledge in this field.

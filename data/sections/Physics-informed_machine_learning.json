(pdes),\none still cannot seamlessly incorporate noisy data into existing\nalgorithms, mesh generation remains complex, and high-\ndimensional problems governed by parameterized pdes cannot be\ntackled. moreover, solving inverse problems with hidden physics is\noften prohibitively expensive and requires different formulations and\nelaborate computer codes. machine learning has emerged as a\npromising alternative, but training deep neural networks requires big\ndata, not always available for scientific problems. instead, such\nnetworks can be trained from additional information obtained by\nenforcing the physical laws (for example, at random points in the\ncontinuous space-time domain). such physics-informed learning\nintegrates (noisy) data and mathematical models, and implements\nthem through neural networks or other kernel-based regression\nnetworks. moreover, it may be possible to design specialized\nnetwork architectures that automatically satisfy some of the physical\ninvariants for better accuracy, faster training and improved\ngeneralization. furthermore, we review some of the prevailing\ntrends in embedding physics into machine learning, present some of\nthe current capabilities and limitations and discuss diverse\napplications of physics-informed learning both for forward and\ninverse problems, including discovering hidden physics and

Despite great progress in simulating multiphysics problems using
the numerical discretization of partial differential equations (PDEs),
one still cannot seamlessly incorporate noisy data into existing
algorithms, mesh generation remains complex, and high-
dimensional problems governed by parameterized PDEs cannot be
tackled. Moreover, solving inverse problems with hidden physics is
often prohibitively expensive and requires different formulations and
elaborate computer codes. Machine learning has emerged as a
promising alternative, but training deep neural networks requires big
data, not always available for scientific problems. Instead, such
networks can be trained from additional information obtained by
enforcing the physical laws (for example, at random points in the
continuous space-time domain). Such physics-informed learning
integrates (noisy) data and mathematical models, and implements
them through neural networks or other kernel-based regression
networks. Moreover, it may be possible to design specialized
network architectures that automatically satisfy some of the physical
invariants for better accuracy, faster training and improved
generalization. Furthermore, we review some of the prevailing
trends in embedding physics into machine learning, present some of
the current capabilities and limitations and discuss diverse
applications of physics-informed learning both for forward and
inverse problems, including discovering hidden physics and tackling
high-dimensional problems.
